The main character is doing okay at coping with his situation but seems t be realizing just how limited mentally his minions may be as they one track minds keep glossing over his directions at times. I am hoping the next book is longer and that he starts dealing with his minions in ways that will reign them in before they make a big mess of things.", "Upvote": "2", "Title": "good story but it felt like it was too short", "Star": "4.0 out of 5 stars", "positivity": 1}, {"Review": "I really do enjoy the series. The way Kugane Maruyama sets this story for the 2nd volume is...Ainz embarks on this journey to gain information and knowledge on this New World that he was suddenly teleported in, so he goes under cover as a mysterious black knight. He also assigns roles to the majority of his floor guardians while he's away. And well let's just say it's amazing.Ainz isn't this omnipotent being that the floor guardians views him as, but he must maintain this omnipotent character for the sake of his guild, while struggling with the internal conflict of loneliness and confusion.I can't wait for the 3rd volume as it's one of my 2nd favorite book out of the 11 volumes.", "Upvote": "2", "Title": "Another Great Book", "Star": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "positivity": 1}]}
