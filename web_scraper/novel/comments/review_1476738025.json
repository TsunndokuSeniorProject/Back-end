I have trouble with books where the main character is not someone I particularly like. But, I gave this one a shot. I was pleasantly surprised. I couldn't help but like the curmudgeon. It's not a deep-thinking book. It's there for entertainment, to make you 'feel' emotions, to transport you to another place and another life. Therefore, I give the book five stars for being exactly what it claims to be--a story about one man and the circle of friends that he makes despite his grouchy personality. I liked the backstory with the wife (even though I thought the author went too far with the tragedy heaped onto this always-optimistic woman). I bought the audio book to listen when I couldn't read and the narrator was flawless. I've heard some pretty bad narrators lately from best-selling books (Miss Peregrine's for example), but this audio book was very well done. I have one gigantic bone to pick with the author. 59 years old is not 89 years old. Fifty-nine years old is when most people are in the apex of careers--before retirement and also having a lot of knowledge and experience to help them in their career fields. The 50-somethings in my office know what an iPad is, how to use computers, have the latest cell phones, and are pretty up on all the new tech gadgets because they are the ones that can afford them! There was no reason why the author couldn't make this a lot more believable by making the main character 79 or older. There was nothing to prevent the backstory being set further back. The whole time I was reading, I had to make myself forget the character was supposed to be 59. For godsakes, the President of the United States is 56!!  I wonder why the author chose such a relatively young main character to act like my grandfather would.  But, if you can overlook that weird decision, the rest of the story is very well done and very entertaining.", "Star": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "Pretend Ove is 79"}, {"Upvote": "438", "Review": "There is a part of me that didn't think I needed to review A Man Called Ove because so many people have read it at this point, but I have talked to a few who have not, hence my desire to write this review.I will admit that I am entirely on the Ove train!The book is about a man, named Ove, who is the angry neighbor that we all seem to have. He complains about everything, has put up signs around his neighborhood with rules about what should and shouldn't be done, and feels there is a proper place for everything. He is not a friendly guy to say the least.Into his life walks or rather drives a family who are to be his new neighbors. He doesn't bother to get to know their names and calls them the pregnant one and the lanky one. After an accident with the lanky one, Ove is forced to help this family, complaining the entire time.Throughout the book Ove also speaks to his wife, complaining about the neighbors, the rule breakers, and how much he misses her (very minor spoiler). During interludes within the narrative, we read about how Ove became Ove. I will say by the end of the book, a bunch of dust was flying around the room and some got into my eyes.The first thing to write is this book is funny. Ove is quite the character and how he treats people is hysterical. He just doesn't care what he says or how he says it. He simply wants order in his world and has lived that way for all of his life. The way he expresses himself becomes incredibly funny.It is also a tragic story. Backman interweaves the two (funny and tragic) quite well and doesn't make it overly heartwarming. This could have easily become a book with the sentiment that we don't know people's past, so don't judge them, but it isn't. Ove is an ass in his past too and sometimes with reason. Backman keeps it level with just enough to make the reader fall for Ove.The great thing is this is a book that pretty much anyone and everyone can (and will) enjoy. I recommended this one for book clubs and discussion groups. Grandmas will like this as well as middle aged men. Ove is simply a good book.I gave this one 5 stars.", "Star": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "A Book for everyone"}, {"Upvote": "14", "Review": "In case you\u2019re one of those few who haven\u2019t heard about this book, here\u2019s what it\u2019s about in a nutshell: a curmudgeonly old man is prevented from killing himself multiple times by neighbors who are needy and people to refuse to obey the sign that restricts parking in the residential area of his small neighborhood. It\u2019s like the movie Up, only with more people that are adults, and more character. Take this paragraph for example:\"For more than fifteen minutes he stood waiting for her at the station in his tight-fitting suit and his new-polished shoes. He was skeptical about people who came late. 'If you can\u2019t depend on someone being on time, you shouldn\u2019t trust \u2019em with anything more important either,' he used to mutter when people came dribbling along with their time cards three or four minutes late, as if this didn\u2019t matter. As if the railway line would just lie there waiting for them in the morning and not have something to do.\"Every sentence in this book is imbued with characterization and style; every word is a brushstroke in the painting of Ove as not only a curmudgeon, but an (spoiler alert!) orphan, a loving husband to a wife who was paralyzed and rendered infertile by a drunk driver, a principled man, a hard worker, a dedicated Saab driver, and one of those loyal-to-the-death-but-you-wouldn\u2019t-know-it-to-talk-to-him kind of people.And, unlike most adult-genre books, especially ones about old people, there is something interesting or amusing or soulful on almost every page.

Backman sketches each scene with deft, bold strokes and yet a light touch. Ove's curmudgeonly approach to the world is akin to an oyster whose crusty shell protects the pearl that grows within. His neighborhood is a rainbow of quirkiness. Backman pokes fun at small town bureaucracy with the \"man in the white shirt,\" and wannabe urbanites with the \"blonde weed wearing sunglasses\" and \"her damned mutt.\"'  He meets his match in a scruffy stray cat that moves in uninvited. The tiny \"Pregnant Foreign Woman\" inserts herself into Ove's life and doggedly pulls him out of his shell. We can all relate to Ove's need for order in a world of chaos and his desire to shrink into his shell when he's been hurt.

I was interesting in the book because of recommendations from friends and its place as a Best Seller, but it's not the kind of thing I usually read. All the same, I have never been so touched by a book that I had to immediately sprint to the internet and share my feelings.Ove is grumpy and awful and the first two chapters left me frowning and upset, wondering who would want to read a book all about someone so unhappy. But minutes later, I was deeply enthralled with the story of Ove. Backman has a unbelievably skill, a heartwarming talent to weave Ove's story through different timelines and a completely breathtaking array of events. I mean it when I say I COULD NOT put this book down. I had to know more about Ove and his life, and I was not disappointed. I am left here with a heart that is full from Ove's story, a heart that breaks for an old (although not that old) man called Ove who somehow found his way into my soul and proceeded to deeply and proundly speak to me about the nature of loss and love and honesty.Each and every character Backman has created has a story to tell, and each of them finds a way to tell it through Ove's eyes. Every second of this book was something refreshing and touching and completely overwhelming. I am unlikely to ever forget what an utterly fantastic book this is, and what a thoroughly talented writer Backman is.

Ole, the protagonist, will always be a clear image in your mind because of his peculiarities.Ole wants to be left alone.  He wants to converse with and think about Sonja, his deceased wife.  He wants people to follow the rules.  He wants order and routine to guide his life.  Uninvited interruptions and improper behavior are not acceptable.  When all these parameters are suddenly violated, Ole\u2019s life becomes, in his mind, unlivable.  He walks around in a huff even as he plans ways to do himself in.Parvaneh, a very pregnant Iranian woman, her husband, and two little girls move in next-door and Ove\u2019s structured world collapses around him.  She\u2019s cheeky, her husband is inept, and the little kids are annoying.  Ove doesn\u2019t like little children anyway.  Then a mangy cat takes over his serene home life and his best friend, who is sometimes his biggest enemy, becomes deathly ill, turning his wife into an Ove slave master.  Her doesn\u2019t like cats, either, and his friend\u2019s wife is becoming tiresome.  None of it is good for Ove.  When will it all end, allowing Ove to join his wife, wherever she is?The author involves his reader in every Ove tribulation.  It\u2019s highly enjoyable companionship albeit with an unwilling escort.  The writing, although unconventional as mentioned, captures the reader in its simplicity as it creates a world of complexity that creates havoc to a simple man of principle.  Ove\u2019s mumbling is memorable, as are caustic encounters with authority.I predict that you will take this book to your heart.

I enjoyed reading it, and am looking forward to the Tom Hanks movie that is in the works for this book.  I felt that the author had a unique approach to his book in that he jumped back and forth across time quite a bit, telling the reader a bit about the present, and then explaining a bit about the past.  (I can\u2019t wait to see how they adapt this to a movie...????). In this way, the reader is slowly able to understand the \u201cbackstory\u201d of Ove, and understand why he behaves in the way he does.  As another reviewer mentioned, there is sort of an underlying current that Ove is probably somewhere on the spectrum of Autism, but the book does not specifically point this out.  However, his background probably influences the behavior to some extent, too.  The translation is very well done, and as someone else already mentioned, the humor is very well preserved across the languages.  You could almost imagine it happened in America, except that the money is in \u201ckronor\u201d.A few less than positive comments, although not enough to dock more than one star.  First, there is a lot of cursing in the book, although half of it is basically British cursing, and quite a lot of it adds to the humor.  It didn\u2019t really bother me, but just keep it in mind if you have a child that wants to read it and you are particular about language.  There is no sex or anything like that.  Also, I felt that some of the characters were overly stereotypical, and some not necessarily vital to the plot.  I would say maybe a modern social issue or two were injected into the story that maybe could have been left out to avoid a controversy.  However, it was not overbearing.  I also felt like a violent event near the end of the book was a bit sudden, to the point of not really going along with the general feel of the book. Like...\u201dWhere did THAT come from???\u201d  I almost felt like the author possibly took a break after writing 3/4 of the book and then came back to finish, because the general feel of the book, to me, changed slightly near the end, and I felt like the coherence of the story struggled at that point.Overall, however, the book was fun to read and was a neat mixture of comical and sad/serious.  It gave a good message about giving people a chance to get to know them before judging them, and also that you never know what someone has gone through in their past.I do think it will make a fantastic Tom Hanks movie.

In Swedish writer Fredrik Backman\u2019s charming first novel, those routines are disrupted with increasing frequency by a varied cast of men, women, and children, to the point where Ove finds that he can\u2019t even carry out the seemingly most straightforward of his intentions.
