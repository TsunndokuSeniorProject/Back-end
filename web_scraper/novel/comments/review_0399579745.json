As an author I've read and studied the original \"Save the Cat\" book a TON, but this version specifically for novelists is INCREDIBLE!! It blew me away and I couldn't put it down! Jessica Brody's writing style is so fun and easy to read and she takes all of Blake Snyder's beats and tips to a whole other level! She elaborates so much more, applying everything to novel-writing, and I also so appreciated the super-detailed Beat Sheets for 10 very diverse best-selling novels. This was seriously the most comprehensive, engaging & applicable book on novel writing I've read to date! It's something that has already helped me improve my current WIP and helped me outline book 2! With how much information is packed in here, I will be pouring over it again and again and using it as my novel-crafting-manual from here on out.", "Star": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "Most comprehensive, engaging & applicable book on novel writing I've ever read!"}, {"Upvote": 0, "Review": "I think this is the best writing book I\u2019ve ever read.

Even pantsers will find the structure presented in this book to be extremely useful.The original \"Save the Cat\" beat sheet for screenwriting has been widely used by writers of all kinds for years, so when I saw that Jessica Brody was writing a \"Save the Cat\" for novelists, I pre-ordered it immediately. I was not disappointed. \"Save the Cat! Writes a Novel\" broke down each \"beat\" with clarity and an easy-going writing style that made it fun to read as well as useful. Each beat was easy to understand, and her method of breaking the structure down makes it possible to absorb the book in smaller chunks if you don't have time to read it in one sitting. I already find myself going back to read over different sections, and I find new, helpful tidbits each time.I have only read through this book completely once, but it has already helped me identify flaws in my current novel that I couldn't quite put my finger on before. Its format makes it easy to use and refer back to while writing. This book will have a permanent place on my work desk.The only con is that the print edition isn't the highest quality. The print is very light in places and difficult to read in low light. This might be a flaw with my copy, but it's worth mentioning for anyone who wears glasses or has other visual disabilities.

I read it all in one sitting, and despite many books built with the same 15 beats, I still managed to tag the thing to oblivion with new pieces of information that will make my novels better.

As others have said, it adapts extremely well from screenplay to novel writing. I've seen a substantial improvement in my novels since I read the original Save the Cat! book.Jessica Brody has (in cooperation with Snyder's publisher) made an outstanding edition of this for novelists. I was pleasantly surprised to find many new insights that had not occurred to me. I am quite convinced it will help me further.If you are unfamiliar with the Save the Cat! method, get this book!  If you are familiar, it is still worth it, for those new insights and more directly novel-oriented approach.As a long-time pantser (one who writes by the seat-of-the-pants instead of using a preplanned structure,) I was skeptical of the model. Yet I found it helped me to understand where I was going with my story, even when I didn't know where I was going in a scene. I no longer consider myself a panster, partly because this method has helped me comprehend my creative flow well enough to write with that flow inside the structure I have planned.I've also combined a beat sheet based on Snyder's Save the Cat! book with one based on Randy Ingermanson's Snowflake Method, which I've put together in Scrivener. I look forward to updating that with the new insights from Jessica Brody.All in all, this is a book that every novelist of every genre and skill level should read.", "Star": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "Outstanding Edition for Novelists"}, {"Upvote": "2", "Review": "I'm only a fraction of the way into it, and I'm already finding SO many amazing tips to help make my novel better, I LOVE it!!", "Star": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "Every writer needs this book!"}, {"Upvote": "6", "Review": "I've read the original Save the Cat!, Save the Cat! Goes to the Movies, and Save the Cat! Strikes Back, and--even though they are geared toward screenwriters and I'm a novelist--they were the best books on story structure I'd ever found...until now.Let me explain. As I began to plot my novel in preparation for Nanowrimo next month, I wondered: Do I need another book on the Save the Cat! method? Is there anything left to add?The answer is a resounding yes! Save the Cat! Writes a Novel not only does a woderful job of translating the Save the Cat! method to the novel format but also expands upon it, contributing elucidation as well as insights all of its own. My favorite is a concept called \"shard of glass\".So whether you're already familiar with the Save the Cat! method of story structure or it is completely new to you, I highly recomend Save the Cat! Writes a Novel. It is indeed \"The Last Book on Novel Writing You'll Ever Need\"!I also recommend the Audible audiobook version. The author does a wonderful job narrating.
