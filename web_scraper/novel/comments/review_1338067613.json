{"Comment": [{"Upvote": "8", "Review": "I am very happy this book came out,I am a very big fan of the the baby sitters club books and I am sooooo happy the 6th book came out! It's very cool that Mallory became the 6th member of the baby sitters club last book,when there were 5 members,in the 5th book,and now,there are 6 members,and its book 6!!!!! Hahaha!!! Its actually funny once you think about it. My favorite part about the book is probably the 5 days watching the kids! And also doing a \"rehearsal wedding\" seems like a great idea! It seems like an example of what the real thing will be like. It seems like an amazing idea for real life with chores,wedding,school plays,and more!!!I can not wait until book 7 comes out!Who is it, I think Mary Anne's turn to do it in 1st person??? And by the way Ann Martin you are a VERY good writer and I have been recommending this series for YEARS. Well that's it from me and thank you for taking the time to read my review.
