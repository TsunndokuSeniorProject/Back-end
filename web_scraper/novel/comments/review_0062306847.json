{"Comment": [{"Upvote": "49", "Review": "I found this story fascinating and complex with many unexpected elements.  The time period matches when enterprising Dutch traders traveled the world including coming to America among the first founding families.  Most activity was controlled by guilds with strict rules about trade, just as daily life was controlled by strict religious rules.  Manner of dress and activity was all dictated as well so there was little room for a free spirit of any kind in Amsterdam.  Into this world enters young Nella who comes from the far freer countryside but because of her revered old family name has been successfully married off to an older and successful business man who seems likely to provide her a good life.  He gives her a huge cabinet sized doll house for a wedding present which she is expected to furnish and through it learn the ways of running the big house she finds herself mistress of.  It's not as easy as it seems though.  Nella finds herself in the midst of unusual and strong willed characters she struggles to understand, not the least of which is the mysterious miniaturist who delivers pieces for her house.The writing is as detailed and precise as a painting by Vermeer and was the perfect style to tell this story.  I thoroughly enjoyed it and stayed up late into the night reading.  This is not a quick beach-read sort of book, but the type to sink into before the fire on a cold winter night.

Plus, she was only in the house for a whole...4 months? I find it hard to believe that after just 4 months Petronella would have been so invested in this family, even if it's technically now her family and she is the lady of the house.

The setting is 17th century Amsterdam, and the author captures perfectly the conflicting sides of the Dutch personality at the time, perfectly describing it as a pendulum between God and guilder. This is the Amsterdam of the Dutch conquerors and the merchants who build their wealth on Eastern trade. It is the Amsterdam of Calvinism, staunch, suspicious, unyielding, unforgiving. Into this city Nell merges as a new bride, eighteen year old and fresh from the country. Her new husband is a wealthy merchant, charming and well liked. For a wedding gift he gives his young bride a cabinet house (doll house) which she begins to fill with minatures. As the story unfolds unsolicited additions arrive from the miniaturist, additions that foretell events in the household before they even happen. Nell attempts to find the mysterious miniaturist while trying to understand the complex characters of her new husband, his strong-willed sister, their maid, and the Black man her husband treats as an assistant in a city in which Blacks are curiosities and inferiors.

Unfortunately there came a point at which I started to suspect that the payoff was not going to be nearly as interesting as everything that was leading up to it and it was a real let down when I realized that my suspicion was correct. I kept reading because I kept hoping that the author would find some way to make this a more perfect story, but in the end it didn't happen.Still, I was absolutely compelled to read the book until the end, which is a testament to the talent of the author and something that hasn't happened to me in quite a while.", "Star": "3.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "Couldn't put it down.

There are far too many unresolved issues remaining when the reader falls off the last page into the sea. For one thing, the title character never actually enters the story, and the point of the figures and miniatures she creates comes to no conclusion. All sorts of loose ends bob in the Dutch tides, as for instance what becomes of the sugar? Why did the hero pull such a raw deal on the heroine in the beginning?

Yes her husband Johannes was older than her but she looked forward to being married and leaving home to a new adventure. Her marriage wasn't anything like she thought it would be. Nella barely saw her husband and had to deal with her miserable and stern sister-in-law. Throughout the book many twist and turns occur, which in turn make Nella stronger.

The writing was superb but I found myself uncomfortable with the many times that author Jessie Burton asked me to forgo common sense and accept the wild outrageous plot points that this story depended upon.While I loved the descriptions of the life and times of seventeenth century Amsterdam I questioned the ability of the miniaturist to foresee the future.  Who was this person?  How did the miniatures get altered?  This was never explained. Why did she vanish half way through the book? Maybe there was something I missed.  Did Johannes actually have a carnal encounter in an alley?  Wasn\u2019t he smarter than that?  The father of Marin\u2019s baby seemed obvious to me from the first mention that she was with child.It is hard for me to explain my feelings towards this book.  Nella, Marin, Cornelia, Otto, Johannes all seemed to be operating independent of each other yet somehow the book held me captive.  I fell into their lives and time from the oppression due to the religious fervor of the period to the description of Marin\u2019s fur underpants (now there is a whole research project in Literature 101).I think that if the author would have locked down her genre I\u2019d have given this book more stars.

The \"heroine\" of the story is Petronella, an 18 year old country girl who married Johannes Brandt, a wealthy trader. As a wedding gift, Johannes gives Nella a miniature house, a replica of the one they live in. For some reason, he thinks that Nella will devote her time to decorating this miniature instead of making demands on him. Nella makes her first order for pieces to add to the house. Following that, eerily, pieces keep arriving, unordered, that prophesy happenings within the home. That is the best part of this entire book: the mystery of who is making the pieces and how they know what is going to happen. The rest of the book just dabbles in too many things: racism, homosexuality, slavery, class division, religion run rampant. These topics are introduced but never fully developed nor are the issues put to rest, they just hang there and are never finalized.

Burton is such a writer. She is not only a talented writer but a writer who can create original characters and a fascinating plot. From the opening pages of \"The Miniaturist\" to its closing, the reader is caught up in a story that unfolds as part mystery, part fantasy, and part coming of age. The main character, a young woman in an arranged marriage begins her married life in late 17th century Amsterdam, a city of enormous wealth. Its citizens are torn between covetousnes and the horrific Calvanistic prejudices practiced by the city fathers and condoned by the church.

The title character is viewed from a distance and largely unexplored, certainly from any personal or emotional point of view, and a relationship that results in a pregnancy is never explained despite the fact that it occurred between a servant and a member of the illustrious family. The destruction of the doll's house seemed bizarre to me, not least because earlier this year I admired it in the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam (thus my interest in reading the book). The abundant praise this book has received is, for me, largely undeserved.

The novel weaves texturally like the carpets that warmed the rooms of their mansions, like the miniature house cabinet comes to life when the protagonist is given it as a wedding gift. Lush descriptions of the perceptions of the people of that era, the main characters are a selection of odd people united in their secrets, the new wife, the controlling sister-in-law, the intersection of colonial business and intimate marriage contracts and the drama of scandal and crisis of justice and punishment.

Yet, she acts with wisdom and insight in many matters, other than her marriage. I could have done without the details of her husband's torture.
