{"Comment": [{"Upvote": "936", "Review": "A Kindle First selection that is masterfully written with complex characters and heart-pounding scenes.  It takes place in Italy -'the forgotten front'- during WW II and the reader is drawn into a web of intrigue.  Pino Lello, 17 years of age, is wise beyond his years and intelligent, as well.  It is a gripping story of resilience, the indomitable spirit of a young man that knew no boundaries and courage that sustained him during dark hours.When reading the first portion, I was wondering if (and how) this intense pace would continue.  The climbing scenes through the mountains gave me a real shot of adrenaline.  I felt as though I was one of the climbers and not a reader.  This is also when the echoes of 'Nessun Dorma' were played with such passion.  For me, this is one of the underlying themes in the story - 'none shall sleep'.  And, Pino Lello has taken that to heart for the remainder of this story.The action intensified throughout the remainder of the book, and one is allowed a rare glimpse into the mind of Il Duce  - Benito Mussolini - plus the inner workings of the German High Command.  Becoming a driver for Major General Hans Leyer allows Pino access to a man that is two steps from the Fuhrer.  Pino Lello witnesses atrocities he wishes he could forget but keeps soldiering on...wisely...Just a gripping and harrowing Kindle First selection which I feel is the best one I have read.  Full of action and suspense which will keep you on the edge of your seat for the duration.Most highly recommended.Please note that this is my Kindle First selection for April 2017.", "Star": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "~~Action/Courage/Resilience - set in Italy during WW II~~"}, {"Upvote": "614", "Review": "I've read nearly every word Mark Sullivan has ever published - so I can say with authority that this work, Beneath a Scarlet Sky, stands as the ultimate fusion of his Pulitzer-nominated journalistic skills and his mastery of the thriller genre, which he's honed at the keyboard he sometimes shares with James Patterson.  He takes us deep inside the love story of his discovery, the unknown hero, Pino Lella, and he crafts an epic tale set against the backdrop of Nazi-occupied Milan and the Italian Alps during World War II that is as intimate and tragic as it is thought-provoking and triumphant.  Every page, every step crackles.  Each twist, rooted in years of first-class reporting, shocks you anew.  Through Sullivan's gripping cast of characters, the unreality and brutality of war meets its match in the guts and wits and soul of Pino Lella, his family, his friends and cohorts.  This heretofore untold story has been etched in my heart and mind with a telling that is equally cinematic and literary.  With this, perhaps his masterwork, Sullivan has reached a pinnacle in storytelling - and readers everywhere, like me, will be better for living it through his words.  Of course, it is Pino Lella we must also praise and thank - for what he did with his young life, his uncommon bravery, his story and letting Sullivan share it with us.

I have been reading a lot of WWII historical books lately. I was not really wanting to read 'another' one. But, we were traveling to Milan, and this true story took place in Milan. So, I bought it, and started reading it a few days before the trip. Once we were in our hotel on the street Corso Matteotti, I was amazed to find out that Pino Lella grew up in that area and at onetime lived on that very street! A very well written book. A very amazing life Pino lived. I did not know that Milan was affected so much by WWII.  I definitely recommend it.

This is one of those rare stories I hope everyone reads and wish everyone had to.  It's intriguing, entertaining and puts you right there.  My tummy was tight with fear, I laughed out loud and I hated what the Greman Nazi's did to Italy and especially to its people.  I had heard before that Italy saved more of it's Jewish population than any other country in Europe and I was glad to be reminded of that.  They deserve to be recognized for their humanity and bravery.  This story was extremely unique in its view of WWII and the German invasion.  I will read it again, it was that good.

The first part of the book is fully credible, as Pino, his brother Mimo and 40 other young boys are sent by his parents to Casa Alpina, a Catholic retreat and school at the foot of the Italians alps, to scape the allied bombing of Milan. The Catholic church has set an escape route into Switzerland, around  The Groppera peak, to smuggle Jews, refugees and down allied pilots out of the Nazi's hands. During the course of several months in 1943, Pino leads a score of people into Switzerland, risking his life to do it. But he's turning eighteen, and subject to the mandatory draft, and his parents have devised a scheme to prevent him from being sent to the Russian front. He enrolls Organization Todt, a Nazi Corp in charge of building infrastructure. And here is where an endless string of coincidences start happening to Pino, beginning with his chance encounter with General Leyers, the second most powerful Nazi on Italy. Pino becomes Leyers' driver, and through his eyes, we learn about all the Nazi atrocities and the allied advances to liberate northern Italy. No question the first part of the book must be true, but so many coincidences happen to Pino, several on a single day on various occasions, that is hard to believe all the rest of the story really happened the way is told by the author.

To me that was the biggest problem, not knowing what was actually the real true story as lived by a teen named Pino and what was artistic license taken by author. He does post a warning of sorts at the opening that he used some freedom and liberties in the telling, retelling from actual events by the main character, and filling in holes with his own/writers words or interpretations.It is a good story of events during the last two years of WWII in Italy, most of it and is focused primarily in northern Italy, Milano and surrounding areas. As such it is a very limited piece of WWII history of Italy because it reads more like a love story which happens during the last and worst two years during the war. It felt like the actual teller of this story Pino is giving us an adolescent view into that first need for  the love of a woman, even though it was just a fantasy at first, and his experiences of life from the perspective of a teenager and that in his telling he left too much to the author to fill in. There are however several important characters in this story that cannot be overlooked, important to WWII history and the horrors of the Nazi and the fascists. Since the story is actually being told by a teenager it is rather difficult to accept as historical.  Unfortunately one of the main and historically important characters, Genaral Leyers  for one, we know very little of and that little is rather confusing and unfinished. Sullivan finished the story leaving us hanging with so many unanswered questions, which he tried to rectify with an addendum with some rather sketchy information pertaining to general Leyers. In my opinion there is not enough informaion given to finish the story. The whole story which features Leyers prominently, is such a disappointed because the truth, the history, is not being clarified. It's sort of a muddled ending leaving the reader puzzled. It would seem to me, that some good investigating should have brought the truth to the surface and given the book a believable ending.  all that the top Nazis did during the war is never something just mentioned in passing. Pino and Leyers were intimately involved throughout the story, and by Pino's telling, which is the story here, General Leyers did atrocious acts and gave orders for slavery and the horrendous mistreatment of these slaves or prisoners, just to mention one atrocity. That is historically important facts but unfortunately are only touched upon in the book. General Leyers was arrested, but then under confusing circumstances is shipped across the borders of Italy, presumably into freedom of Austrian border carrying a heave briefcase which supposedly contained gold billions he had stolen. Then he suddenly is imprisoned with war  criminal prison, was also handled by a court, not Nuremberg, and released after only 23 months. Nothing is told us about details of trial, records from his incarceration, why he was released at all when Pino made such a credible witness against him. Pino was his driver and translator and even allowed in the generals home to co-mingle with their maid who was his love interests. So there is supposedly plenty of witnessed horror as told in  the story but nobody asked this young man about this war criminal?My final conclusion to what I gained from this story is not so much a WWII horror story involving a Nazi war criminal, but a love story between a very young and inexperienced teen and a mature woman, which was mostly a fantasy for the boy but over the course of the story and his persistence turns into  real but sweet young love during  the last two years of WWII in northern Italy. During those two years we are traveling along with a very immature teen through his life experiences. Part of that experience i s his becoming the driver and translator for the Nazi General Leyers.I guess I am most disappointed in the lack of facts, historical facts, which are not followed through to a believable conclusion. Without that conclusion all we have is a love story which isn't exactly history making,  True, this love story unfolds in the middle of life during the final two years of WWII in Italy. In spite of the story touching on the atrocities committed by Nazi and Fashist factions it's still a teen love story. Anything else is simply left unfinished, unresolved and left me confused and very let down.I still think this could be a fantastic piece of previously uncovered WWII history of great importance if only Sullivan had done more investigative work and less memoirs, had actually finished the work.Other than that I found the writing somewhat tediously detailed, especially trying to explain locations in Italy, like trying to write a map with words. Including a map of Italy would have made it so much more visual and less wordy.", "Star": "3.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "A great idea not seen through to a believable conclusion. Definitively a Novel."}, {"Upvote": "6", "Review": "This story takes place in Italy during the last two years of WWII.  It's a well-written historical fiction based on a real-life 17 year old hero, whose story until now, was largely unknown.Pino Lella was only 17 in 1943 when he began leading Jews over the Alps to safety in Switzerland. He went on to become a spy for the Partisan Resistance Movement in Italy while serving as the driver for a top Major General in Hitler's High Command. Pino risked his life repeatedly, gathering information for the Resistance and Allied forces until the war ended.While this book is historical fiction, it is based on in-person interviews the author Mark Sullivan had with then 79 year old  Pino Lella, as well as other extensive research he did over a ten year period. (Pino Lella is still living in Italy, and in his nineties.) Originally Sullivan planned on writing a nonfiction biography of Pino, but the Nazis so thoroughly destroyed their files in the last days before surrendering to the Allied forces, making a complete and accurate story virtually impossible. Sullivan felt Pino's story was so compelling, he decided to write it in a fictional format for posterity rather than not write it at all.This truly is a compelling story. It's the story about the war, but one we haven't heard before. It's about the atrocities, but also about heroism and bravery. And there's a poignant love story that should touch even the most stoic among us. The writing is very straightforward.  It doesn't go back and forth in time, and it doesn't switch from one character's p.o.v. to another's. It's the story from Pino's eyes, told vividly and simply.I think it's definitely worthy of 4.5 stars.", "Star": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "Compelling story, written in a simple and straightforward way"}, {"Upvote": "16", "Review": "I'm not sure why I am bothering with this review -- with 4,000+ other reviews, my thoughts don't count.  However, here I am -- I review books and music (and occasional other things) on Amazon.com, so why not?\"Beneath a Scarlet Sky\" is not a well written book.  It's kind of like a graphic novel without the graphics.  His prose is basic -- functional, but not at all elegant -- and there's no subtlety or nuance in what he writes.  Yet, like a cartoon, it's action packed and easy to read, and the story he tells definitely falls into the category of \"amazing but true\".  The saga of Pino Lella, who served as a chauffeur to (and partisan spy of) the second in command of Nazi-controlled Italy towards the end of WWII is literally incredible, but it is true, and it's filled with the \"Bams!\" and \"Pows!\" that any good action cartoon should have.  It also contains lots of sweetness -- often too much so -- when the author discusses Mr. Lella's family, the love of his life, his passion for the terrain of northern Italy, and so much more. I must also say that the book is so action-packed that I finished all 500+ pages in three days.  One unexpected plus of the book is that it doesn't attempt to wrap up his life in a neat package with a bow; he was what he was, and the book sort of ends without an ending.

There\u2019s something about a combination of tragedy, espionage, romance, late-night bombing raids, and the overwhelming fear of death that has given many a writer great ideas for tales. This book is actually based on a true story. What makes it somewhat more appealing is that the story takes place in Italy. What other World War II  stories do you know that have taken place in Italy?  Not many. What exactly was Italy\u2019s role in World War II anyway?  Weren\u2019t they one of the three \u2018bad guys\u2019 headed by the unstable fascist Il Duce (Benito Mussolini)?True, but by 1942, Italy was already \u2018conquered\u2019 and the majority fled their lukewarm allegiance towards Hitler and the axis and then turned towards the allies.  By 1944, when this story starts, the country, however, was filled with black-shirt fascists who never turned, as well as German Gestapo agents everywhere.  It\u2019s in this environment that we meet our protagonist, 17-year-old Pino Lela. Like most boys 17 thrown in a middle of war, he\u2019s obviously having to grow up quite fast. All he wants to really do is find a girl and fall in love. He makes an attempt to woo a stranger on a street \u2013 beautiful 23-year-old Anna \u2013 who halfheartedly agrees to meet him at the cinema later in the evening. It\u2019s quite obvious she\u2019s just trying to get rid of this testosterone filled adolescent and move on with whatever she\u2019s doing.It\u2019s a good thing she stands him up, as the theater is bombed during a night raid. Pino finds himself thrust into the war at this point. It\u2019s high time for him to do something to help the cause. We then see Pino recruited for a couple of dangerous missions that basically take up the bulk of the book. His adventures aren\u2019t really connected, but it\u2019s still quite the adventure.  Of course, every few pages, we read about his fascination with Anna \u2013 the girl he met for a total of about two minutes. He can\u2019t stop thinking about her. Well, this IS a somewhat true story, but when we read about Anna so often, it\u2019s obvious that she\u2019s bound to show up again in our story.So, yes, our war tale contains a fair bit of romance along with tragedy. To be frank, the tragedy and travails of a world war seem a bit toned down in this book. My guess is the author didn\u2019t want to gross out any of his readers. So even though we read about citizens being murdered by firing squads, forced slavery, and trains filled with Jews heading to Auschwitz, I never really felt the pain and remorse that I think I should have felt. Pino seemed a tad too lovestruck throughout the pages for his surroundings to ever appear too grim.  The book seemed \u2018PG\u2019 rated when I felt it should have been a hard \u2018R\u2019 for the emotions to really sink in as they should.I also felt that had this NOT been a true story, I would have enjoyed the last quarter of the book better. We must remember that real life doesn\u2019t always give us stories the way we wish they would be told, so I need to give the author a \u2018pass\u2019 when certain events didn\u2019t happen the way that I was hoping they would.Truth be told, the story is told very well, so one can easily forget that we\u2019re reading about a true account. The very end of the book does a good job summing up the \u2018Where are they now?\u201d portion of the main figures that survived the tragedy.  Again \u2013 some unanswered questions and some events unfolding a bit differently than one would want. As I write this review, the book is supposedly being made into a mini-series.  I\u2019m thinking it will be a good one. It\u2019s definitely a bit too varied to be summed up into one nice, neat movie.  Somehow, I\u2019m guessing the nastier elements of the war will be toned down as well. I guess that\u2019s probably a good thing \u2013 if that\u2019s what most people want.", "Star": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "\"But the world's focused on France, and forgotten Italy\""}, {"Upvote": "5", "Review": "First book written by Mark iv'e read....wont be the last !.....Thanks to kindle for listing New York times bestsellers.......Would have loved to have visited Milan in 2011, all I saw was the interior of the rail station at night, that in itself was exhilarating......no other rail station we saw like that.Unsure of a writer's style and would I like the book, I plunged in, one page after another the story unfolded, and I felt this is the best novel Iv'e read this year and Iv'e read some very good ones.I liked how the true story of Italian patriots further modified my views from my early youth of giving an ear to bigots as to the Italians being enemies of the allies during WW11.

Originally I was attracted to this novel by its never-before-told aspect along with its emphasis on Italy and the often-overlooked heroes within that country. I had previously read \"From Sand and Ash\" which first introduced me to this branch of WW2 history even though it was a completely fictitious story. I expected \"Beneath a Scarlet Sky\" to provide a more accurate account of a real-life person who had been involved in these events. Unfortunately, I have been incredibly disappointed.First, let me say that regardless of how much of this is actually true (and I have my doubts), this fictionalized version of Pino Lella is so unrealistic. Essentially, he's a seventeen-year-old prodigy who can do no wrong. He is strong, clever, exceptionally skilled at pretty much anything he attempts, and he doesn't seem to have any real conflict with or animosity toward anyone (well, except the Nazis). He is quite possibly one of the most unrelatable characters that I've ever come across in a literary work. Just as ONE example, here is a future race car driver complimenting Pino on what a gifted driver he is, because of course he is:\"Pino allowed a mild smile. \u201cYou catch on fast. I wish I could have finished my driving lessons.\u201d \u201cYou are already very, very good, Pino,\u201d Ascari said. \u201cYou have the touch, the feel for the car that is rare.\u201d Pino basked in the praise.\" p. 163 (Kindle edition)Since all the attention is given to Pino and his amazing accomplishments, the supporting characters are extremely bland and indistinguishable. The only thing I really knew about each character was if they were \"good\" or \"bad\" (and this was primarily based on whether or not they were German).Second, I was surprised by the simplicity of the writing. At times, the text reads like a middle-grade textbook as it lists off names, facts, and dates. The dialogues felt very stilted and occasionally only consisted of a couple of lines before ending abruptly. If it was going to be so concise, did there really need to be a dialogue at all?While I normally get frustrated with authors who insist on including excessively detailed descriptions of the characters and their surroundings, this book had almost none. This made it hard for me to immerse myself in 1940s Italy. At first, I assumed that perhaps this author just doesn't care to spend a lot of time on superfluous descriptions. However, the passages about Pino hiking went on and on FOREVER! Here were the descriptions I wanted back when I was first introduced to the characters in Milan, but now they were unnecessarily lengthy and only focused on a single character and his \"treacherous\" hikes through the Alps.Third, precious little in this book actually feels plausible or authentic. There are so many instances of characters (especially Pino) who just happen to be in the right place at the right time. The moment where this novel lost ALL credibility was when Pino, after almost single-handedly digging out from an avalanche, goes skiing with a pregnant woman clutching onto his back. This woman, who had been spotting blood only moments before and felt so weak she couldn't go on, lets out a \"Wheeeeeeee\" as they race downhill and then plays her violin for him after they reach safety. Ummmm, no. I've read historical fiction with completely fabricated characters and situations that have felt less fictional than this.It grieves me so much - especially considering this is based upon real heroes - but I can neither continue this nor recommend it to others.

In the words of a fictional character I love, \"We're all stories in the end...\" Pino Lello definitely made it a good, and heroic, story.\u00a0Beneath a Scarlet Sky follows the life of Pino Lello, his family and some of the people he knew during WWII in Italy. The book weaves a fabulous tapestry of a family, who showed courage in different ways, resisted in a thousand different acts, and persisted despite the horrors around them. This book comes reviewed by thousands of people, and rated very highly overall. It deserves every bit of praise it has received.Disclaimer: Beyond this point you can argue that there are spoilers, though not specific ones. If you don't want to read about them skip the rest of the review, but know that I whole-heartedly recommend this book to anyone who likes reading historical fiction, and works based on real-life events.\u00a0This book reads like a spectacular tale of historical fiction, and the writing is on par with another of my favorite books,\u00a0The Nightingale.\u00a0-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The book opens with Pino in Milan, where he grew up, in the fashion district. His family are craftsmen, designers, musicians, and these colorful influences informed Pino's identity. Maybe it was those crucial moments who shaped the boy Pino was and the man he became. Either way he used those moments to do what needed: to help. Pino's parents know the war is coming, and soon after the bombing began sent Pino to a remote Catholic school in the Italian Alps where they had vacationed and traveled before. Pino is experienced in the terrain, he knows the conditions, and before he even realizes it the Father there is training Pino to help people get out of Italy and into Switzerland. From there it is a chain reaction decisions, actions, and coincidence that led to Pino become an important spy in the fight against the Nazis.The prologue shut me up, and made my inner cynic sit down for a while. I\u00a0didn't know until the Prologue that it was about an actual man, before that I was all set to write a snarky review about the luckiest fictional spy WWII ever saw. That sounds horrible now, given what Pino witnessed and suffered, and I can't explain it without spoilers, but trust me that I do know that this great man saw true horror.The ugly truth is, as in any war, a person is lucky just to make it out. Whether they kept their heads down or if they spent years resisting their conquerer's efforts, people were lucky to survive. Somehow that wasn't the case for Pino, this book and it's prologue make it obvious that Pino didn't just survive the war, he found ways to live during it. That's part of what makes the story seem so unbelievable. If it took skill and cunning to survive, what did it take to live and find an enduring love during war?", "Star": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "Powerful enough to make a cynic sit down and shut up."}, {"Upvote": "3", "Review": "Reading this beautifully written book gave me insight and understanding into what had happened in Italy during WWII.

During and immediately after the war, death was indiscriminate and pervasive and yet strangely exclusive.Pino witnessed and suffered loss after heartbreaking loss. He had to continually find new reasons to choose life and living.Pino was given many years on this earth. Years filled with youth and adventure, bravery and heartache, love and passion, surprises and changes, and choices and consequences.Such a well written book that was obviously a labor of love for the author.

Pino doesn't think himself a hero, but I think heroic events happen when ordinary people step up and selflessly do the right thing in difficult and dangerous times. I especially liked the scene (vague not to spoil) when he's trapped with others and wants to just curl up and cry. \"I'm only a 17-year-old boy\", yet he sees responsibility to others & overcomes his crippling fear.This story made WWII become real to me. It's one thing to read facts about it (which this book has plenty of -- some I just skimmed over because it was too much for me, though did get me interested in Italy), but another to hear a personal eyewitness's description. I understand the \"amnesia\" to try to forget the horrific atrocities of this time, but I think it's important to know what happened; the reality of evil, the good in the midst of bad, the importance of people met along the way, the danger of mob mentality, and so many other lessons to be learned from history.Thank you, Mark Sullivan, for pursuing this story.

The talk was given some years ago at a local college and attended by the survivors and those who helped them. It is somewhat disconcerting and sad when some reviewers dismiss this history as proof that the events told are untrue. Life can be and often is stranger than fiction. I was deeply touched in the end by Mr. Lella's faith and by his view of life and its moments as a gift.  The story told in the novel is a testament to humanity's capacity for evil but also for our capacity for selflessness and love. There are lessons here, particularly regarding how foolish and tragic it can be to judge an individual too quickly as well as the dangers of the mob mentality. Thank you Mr. Sullivan and Mr. Lella for reminding us all of these truths.

The story is a true one, but not one most are familiar with, since the war's impact on Milan is not as well-known as stories about the Resistance in Paris.  There was a resistance in Milan, and many people found themselves having to choose sides, at great cost no matter the choice.  Saving Jews from the Nazis is so heroic that any story about it is worthy of reading.  The hero of this historical novel was a real person who did amazing things he never dreamed would be required of him.The writing is very good, and aside from a very few unnecessary profanities that seemed thrown in just for effect, bordered on excellent prose.  There aren't many, only a handful.Having traveled extensively in Italy I loved the descriptions of towns and street names and landmarks that evoked fond memories for me.  There were many heroic Italians in WWII and you will meet several key figures in the pages of this historical novel that takes a true story and presents it like a spy/action novel, entertaining, sobering, and uplifting.  Humans endure a lot in war time, but our humanity emerges brightly when there is a need for service and sacrifice.  Pino Lella was a common man who became a hero that few in the world knew was one.

Pino is a nondescript 17 year old, son of upper middle class parents, whose primary focus in life (as most 17 year old young men) was to have a good time with his friends and begin to enjoy the companionship of young women.  As events unfold,  Pino is nearing the point when he must take part in the war (enlist or get drafted/conscripted). If he joins the Nazi's, he will be sent to the Russian front where the survival rate is about 50%, so his parents encourage him to join the \"Organization Todt\", where Italian men stayed in Italy supporting the German war effort in building trucks, weapons, ammunition, and other supplies to aid the Nazis.  Pino is vehemently opposed to helping the Nazis, whom he despises, but his father convinces him by telling him he can do more good as an \"observer\" (spy), passing inside information back to the Italian partisans resisting the German army.  As it turns out, he has acquired expert driving skills, and through serendipitous events he is assigned as the \"driver\" for German General Hans Leyer, the #2 Nazi leader in Italy, with close ties to Hitler. Much of the book details his travels and service for General Leyer, and he is able to pass valuable intelligence back to the partisans. General Leyer has lodgings in Milan, and Pino meets and falls in love with the General's Italian maid, Anna. That story line, their romance, is well written as well.  As it begins to become clear that the Allies are making significant progress, General Leyer realizes that Germany will be defeated, and he begins to put in place records that will portray him as an American sympathizer, while still dutifully supplying needed equipment and food to the Nazi war effort. No spoilers here, but the end game in the book is extremely well-written, and through both tragedy and the joy of finally freeing Italy of the Nazis we have an eyewitness account of how the retreating Nazis, their fascist collaborators, and the partisans ultimately play significant roles in the final months and days of the war.

The story takes place during the last two years of the war and it tells the story of this young man who sees the atrocities committed by the Nazi occupation and is drawn into taking action of his own to help his countrymen.  He assists a number of Jewish Italians to escape the Nazis by guiding them across the Alps into Switzerland under the guidance of a local priest.His parents insist he volunteers for a position in the German army in a non-combatant role to avoid being forced into a combat position.  His parents seemingly belong to the resistance and Pino provides them with information helpful to the Allies.  In the interim, he falls in love with the maid to the whore of his immediate commanding officer who is the second highest officer of Nazi forces in Italy.His exploits, his bravery, his spirit and, yes his vulnerability makes one so proud of this young man.  The atrocities he witnessed would be life enduring.We meet a group of characters that we really care about and cry at their fates but Pino leaves a lasting memory.
