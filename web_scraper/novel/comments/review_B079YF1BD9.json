{"Comment": [{"Upvote": "13", "Review": "Are Kira and Werner star-crossed lovers? That\u2019s what I asked myself as I clung to each page, wanting to know. This is no ordinary love story. It\u2019s so much more. A thrilling read that starts with an interview with a Russian hero brings the interviewer in contact with a woman. When they sit down to learn about the story behind a photo that shows a girl holding a rifle on the war front in Russia the plot moves back in time to Poland 1939. This is when Kira and Werner meet and fall in love. They are from ally nations, Russia and Germany, but with the Nazi regime\u2019s aggression escalating and Hitler\u2019s desire to conquer the world all peaceful bets are off and Stalin, the leader of Russia, becomes his enemy throwing the two countries into war.  During this interlude Kira and Werner continue their long distance romance and become engaged, much to Kira\u2019s father\u2019s dislike and forbidden orders. Once war breaks out Kira works as a translator and Werner is in the German army bound for the icy winter of Russia. When Kira gets word that her father had been shot during battle her life takes a dramatic turn. She joins up to go to the frontline to become a sniper. There is no lack of conflict and tension in this incredible read where the reader is thrust forward wondering, as Kira does, if she will end up killing the man she loves.  This is a story as much about the devastations of war as it is about the power and connection of love. It\u2019s painfully gripping in detail and beautifully written. The level of research and factual detail of the battles, the conditions in the wintery devastating cold in Russia are brilliantly described, the Nazi\u2019s advancements and background historical data is spot-on.  It\u2019s a novel story in which the author places a woman on the fighting front in a time when women rarely did much in war times than supportive at home activities. Our heroine is believable and authentic as is her lover. I absolutely loved this read right down to the gut-wrenching surprising ending. Destined to be a classic!", "Star": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "Great book"}, {"Upvote": "9", "Review": "I like historical fiction, and I read a lot of it. And I read tons of World War II books. This is truly one of the best war books I've ever read. Yes, it's a beautiful and poignant love story, like many other reviewers have noted, but that's not what makes this book so amazing to me. And, while absolutely admirable, the amount of historically accurate details also isn't what I liked best.What is absolutely incredible about this book is Ellie Midwood's portrayal of the devastating effects of war on everyday people -- and that's who Werner and Kira are. They belong to different countries and to governments that are at war, and Ellie Midwood shows them as real people, both sympathetic characters, thrown into the chaos and devastation of war.They both do things that are unthinkable to us in our peaceful lives and that were unthinkable to them before the war started, yet each of them remains a human being with dignity, self-respect, and respect for others, no matter how hard the circumstances are. And their circumstances are incredibly hard. The alternating perspectives of Werner and Kira telling their side of the story make them both believable and relatable.This is one of the best books I've ever read, and I read a lot of books. You have to read this book!", "Star": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "Amazing World War II story"}, {"Upvote": "4", "Review": "Every time I pick up a book by Ellie Midwood, I know I'm in for a special treat. This woman is the queen of WWII era historical fiction for good reason--her stories resonate across the decades, filled with beautifully researched settings and compelling, unforgettable characters. Somehow, no matter what country her characters are fighting for, she manages to show humanity in all its facets--raw, beautiful, ugly and terrifying--and how love can survive against all odds. A Motherland's Daughter, A Fatherland's Son is just such a story. I found myself immediately drawn into the tale of star-crossed lovers, Kira and Werner, who meet and fall in love just prior to the war. Before they can be married, war tears them apart. Werner, a German, is sent to the front and ends up an officer. Kira, a Soviet sharpshooter, enlists as a sniper and is sent to the front as well. The horrors of war scar them both, taking them to the depths of hell, yet both cling to the memory of the love they shared in a more innocent time. I found myself completely riveted to this story, cheering for them both to survive, and to make it back to the other. I won't give away the ending but I will say it had me in tears! This book was so well done. I recommend it to all historical fiction lovers!", "Star": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "heartache and triumph"}, {"Upvote": "3", "Review": "Ms. Midwood does it again by bringing an amazing story to life. She has a way of weaving together fact and fiction pretty much seamlessly. This is one of the things that I love about her writing. This book is very well written. I love how she uses both Kira\u2019s and Werner\u2019s points of view to really tell a story that pulls at your emotions. I have gone from wanting to strangle the main characters to wanting to just comfort them. The roller coaster ride from one emotion to another goes quickly and takes you through multiple turns and twists. In A Motherland\u2019s Daughter, A Fatherland\u2019s Son you can see a portion of WWII from both the German side (Werner), and the Russian side (Kira). Ms. Midwood really did her research with this one, and in such a way that one point of view does not overshadow the other. She didn\u2019t shy away from exposing atrocities committed by both sides. Let\u2019s face it, war is ugly, but Ms. Midwood brings you a beautiful tale through that ugliness. I won\u2019t lie. There are some parts even I got a little squeamish with. This is one book that is a must read for all people that have an interest in the WWII era. You will learn something different, and while much of the story is fiction, there is still quite a bit of fact thrown in. All in all, I absolutely loved this book, and I feel like this is one of her best works to date.", "Star": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "A Must Read"}, {"Upvote": "2", "Review": "I have had the pleasure of reading two of Ellie Midwood's books previously and enjoyed them thoroughly, and A Motherland's Daughter, A Fatherland's Son is no different. Reading one of her books is a total-immersion experience into life during World War II. Midwood's vast knowledge of that time period is remarkable and is a big part of what gives her stories depth: the intensity of the backdrop of a horrific war. She doesn't skimp on the details of the brutality of war, either. What she writes is gut-wrenchingly real.The second element that gives her stories amazing depth is her characters. She develops them to such a degree that I cannot help but laugh, cry, and scream with them. In this story, we follow the lives of lovers Kira and Werner, a Russian woman and a German man who fall in love in 1939 right before Germany declares war on Russia.The story is told in an alternating point-of-view style, where one chapter is told from Kira's point of view and the next chapter from Werner's. From this first-person perspective, I get into the head of the characters even more. They start out as idealistic young people, who believe in love and that they have their whole lives ahead of them to do what they wish. They will marry and be happy. The war devastates their lives, throwing them into the pile with millions of others whose lives are also being ruined by the horror of war.Can they still come out of all this after the war is through as the same people? After seeing and performing awful deeds? After experiencing some of the worst moments of humanity and their own lives? Lovers whose countries dictate they are enemies?Kira is enlisted as a sniper in the Red Army. Werner serves as a lieutenant in the Wehrmacht. The story follows the events of the war through its end in 1945 on the eastern front. It's easy to look back at history and want to blame the Germans, to mark them at the bad guys, but when you realize that many of these soldiers were just young man, pretty much boys, it breaks my heart. So much loss of life for both sides, which is clearly shown in this story. So much senseless death. It's no wonder both Kira and Werner question if they are who they were when they met, if love and hope still hold any meaning in a world shattered by such darkness.The stakes are high, ridiculously, impossibly high. I kept turning the pages because I needed to believe that the inherent goodness in people, especially Kira and Werner, would win, that victory of the Allies during the war is one thing, but getting down to the level of person-to-person, victory of the heart matters, too. Love wins, right?I happily give this book five stars!", "Star": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "A Heart-Wrenching World War II Romance"}, {"Upvote": "4", "Review": "\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1fAs though love and war aren't enough, imagine being on the opposing side fighting against the man you love! Torn between love and war, desire and fear...this book was such an intense read for me. It evoked so many emotions - what a ride this book has been! Some of the scenes had me literally on the edge of my seat, cringing with horror and feeling like I'd just been gut-punched. And then on the flip side, there are other scenes handled so delicately, with a feather's touch. So much research, time, and thought went into this story, and I really commend the author for this -- to create something so beautiful based on such horrifying true events, and to show us all sides of the story so masterfully, was brilliant!

You can't help but like them.  And the author does a masterful job of evolving them, maturing and hardening them as their nations, which they love, force them to grow up quickly and fight for them.Werner (German) and Kira (Russian) have fallen in love at the one of the most inopportune moments in history.  They believe, however, the war will end soon and their budding relationship can survive the brief separation since there is an alliance between their two countries.That hopes nearly fades to darkness when the alliance ends and Germany and Russia war against one another.Nobly, on either sides, shooting at strangers across the lines, worried their love is over there, Werner and Kira cling to that tether of normalcy, each believing their love is the only sane thing left to get them through the cruelty and horrors.  And there are plenty.  The author has done her homework and the writing is crisp, quick and powerful.  The history impeccable.  The reader in drawn right into the bowels of terror and death.

Predominantly a love story that unravels on the raging front lines of WWII battle, the reader is brought face to face with the capacity for utter depravity, malice, and generosity of spirit of which we are all capable.Kira and Werner, lovers separated by their uniforms and allegiances to the Motherland and Fatherland, respectively, enter the war not more than mere children themselves. And as Kira observes of the enemy SS soldiers advancing on Soviet borders, they're only boys themselves. Yet the atrocities of war create the backdrop against which these two characters are shaped, both eventually yielding to the same instincts. \"Maybe it\u2019s better that we don\u2019t have mothers anymore; they wouldn\u2019t have recognized us when we returned,\" Kira observes. The expertise and ease with which she's become a heroic killing machine is her new identity.Amidst the devastation, ruin, and loss of who they once were, can there be redemption? Ironically, while friends and family have been lost in service to their homelands, there is no home left to which to return. And when once-lovers don uniforms that now denote them as enemy combatants, can the human spirit triumph? I will not answer that question here. This absorbing book is well worth reading to find the answer.I highly recommend this historical novel and look forward to exploring this author's work in far more dept.

It\u2019s historical fiction and wartime fiction for sure, going deep into the atrocities that happen in war. But it\u2019s also an epic love story with the kind of Deus Ex Machina coincidences you get in a romance novel. And of course it\u2019s a coming of age story for two young soldiers during WWII, Werner and Kira.I liked this novel a lot because it\u2019s really well written- heartbreakingly, viscerally so. Both protagonists are incredibly strong characters, neither of them is perfect, both of them commit atrocities- in fact, at certain points in the novel, it\u2019s almost a competition of who has bloodier hands, but no matter what, you never lose your sympathy for two young people caught up in a war not of their making and trying to survive.I feel like the ending was a little too convenient and rushed and not as creative as the rest of the novel but overall this tale of star-crossed lovers was a really interesting historical depiction of the Soviet-German conflict during World War 2. This is not a novel that makes a specific judgment call on the Nazis or the communists as being bad or good. Obviously, there are references to the racist and fascist regime of Nazi Germany but this book doesn\u2019t necessarily therefore make it that the soldiers of Nazi Germany were the villains of the novel. This is a novel that portrays how devastating war is even to those who volunteer to serve and protect their countries and how far removed these soldiers are from the ideologies and strategies they are made to fight for.
