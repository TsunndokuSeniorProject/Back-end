{"Comment": [{"Upvote": "112", "Review": "I received an advanced copy of The Girl Who Lived.I am a huge fan of the Jack Stratton Series, by Christopher Greyson, so I was excited to receive The Girl Who Lived. I like mystery, suspense, thrillers, and psychological thrillers in general. This book definitely fits into those categories.Although the writing style is Christopher Greyson it is a departure from the Jack Stratton Series. The Girl Who Lived is a bit darker, it deals with survivors guilt and addictions that manifest themselves after a horrendous crime and the aftermath. The main character, Faith, feels she is a broken person. She is alive, but not living. I think anyone reading this book that can relate to her anxiety, despair, and emptiness will appreciate her struggle. But you don't need to be a survivor to get wrapped up in the suspense.I was totally surprised by the ending. I didn't see it coming. But all of the puzzle pieces start to fall into place as you look back.I thought the first two chapters were a bit slow, but you really want to hang in there. I think those first few chapters explain where Faith is and why. Then the story starts picking up... and then I could not put down the book. I was reading from about 12:30am to 6:30am. I was going to read just until I fell asleep. But it is morning, my eyes are dry and bloodshot and it is time to feed the dog breakfast.", "Star": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "Intriguing Psychological Thriller"}, {"Upvote": "27", "Review": "Rugged, unbreakable, resilient, and tough as nails are just a few ways one could describe Faith. Her life was nearly perfect. Even though she didn't have her sisters looks, she seemed to have everything else. A loving family and a beautiful friendship.It was all taken. Everything she had. How can someone begin to pick up the pieces? This novel proves there is only one way... revenge.Faith was willing and wanting to give her life to put a hault to her pain. She was so fragile. Never have I seen a more marvelous transition in a character. Faith transforms from delicate to durable so quickly you contemplate rereading the second portion of the book.The spiraling of events will leave you crying, hoping, and petrified. I felt an immense amount of compassion and remorse for our protagonist. I could not set this book down!No one can be trusted. Hell, some of them might not even truly exist. Faith finds comfort in very few people and then learns they cannot be trusted either. She is exhausted with the constant internal struggle; deciding whether or not to live. If she didn't live, she wouldn't find the putrid man that stole her innocence, her childhood, and essentially, her entire life. We learn the true meaning of coward here.A huge thumbs up to Christopher Greyson. I thought this was immaculately written and beautifully finished. The ending is spectacular and non predictable. It has been a long time since i enjoyed reading something so much and I will continue to sing its praises until everyone I know reads it.", "Star": "4.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "Her life was nearly perfect.

This book features a damaged young woman trying to hold her life together and solve the murder of her parents, while being disbelieved by almost everyone she meets, and having a history of being institutionalized.  How's that for a challenging plot?  It seems like as soon as she is released on the streets, she is attacked by the man she can't get anyone else to believe in, who she saw kill her family.You will cheer for her successes, sigh at her missteps and thank anyone who tries to help her.  A good read.", "Star": "4.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "The world doesn't believe her, but she perseveres"}, {"Upvote": "15", "Review": "This was an excellent read that kept me on my toes from the first page to the last.  I am not much of a sleuth, so as I read the book I kept thinking, \u201cdon\u2019t trust him\u201d or \u201cdon\u2019t trust her.\u201d.  The ending was a surprise to me although I\u2019m sure there are those who will say it was obvious from the beginning.  It never is to me, so I always wonder about those kinds of statements.  Anyway, this was a book about a young woman, Faith, whose father, sister, best friend and best friend\u2019s mother were all murdered when she was 14 years old.  She was there when it happened and got a look at the killer that she dubbed \u201crat face.\u201d  However, most people don\u2019t believe her about \u201crat face,\u201d and believe that her father was the one who killed all the others and then himself. She managed to run away when her sister urged her to run (at the expense of being killed herself).  Ten years later she has spent a lot of time in mental hospitals trying various medications and has just received probation.  She has a schedule to follow of attending various support group meetings and meetings with her probation officer and is not to use alcohol or own firearms.  Sometimes she annoyed me with her breaking of the rules, but most of the time I just really felt for her.  She meets people back in her home town and learns different things about how everything actually transpired as opposed to things she had believed. She is trying to find \u201crat face,\u201d but it is difficult for her to get anyone to believe her or to help her.  The book just had me enthralled from beginning to end and I highly recommend it.", "Star": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "Highly recommended"}, {"Upvote": "16", "Review": "So far i\u2019ve read the entire jack Stratton series and now this book; the girl who lived.I believe his books keep getting better.

That being said, I'm actually more a fan of Greyson's Jack Stratton novels.  This one was just a little too dark and heavy for me.  The Jack novels have more light-hearted moments and are more of a fun read.

The Girl Who Lived takes the reader inside the head of a girl who narrowly escaped a massacre, complete with survivor's guilt, second-guessing, and fantasies of suicide.Ten years earlier, Faith Winters and her sister Kim were on their way to their family's cabin to celebrate Faith's thirteenth birthday with their father; Faith's best friend, Anna; and Anna's mother. On their way from the parking area, Faith noticed a creepy-looking, rat-faced man watching them. Kim entered the cabin first and emerged seconds later, bleeding from a fatal stab wound, and screamed for Faith to run.The police concluded that Faith's father and Anna's mother were having an affair. Something went terribly wrong\u2014perhaps she was about to break up with him\u2014which caused him to snap and kill her, with their daughters as collateral damage, and then shoot himself in the back of the head. Faith doesn't want to believe it, but her memory of the event is hazy. Except for a clear image of the man from the parking lot whom she has nicknamed Rat Face, and whose existence the police are unable to confirm.Since the murders of her sister, father, and friends, Faith's life has been purgatory. She has suffered bullying, fought addiction, tangled with the law, and been in and out of mental institutions. Her mother, a therapist, dealt with her own grief by writing a memoir, ironically titled The Girl Who Lived, which exposes Faith's struggles. The therapy exercise became a bestseller, so Faith can't go anywhere now without being recognized, pitied, and feared.When the story opens, Faith is being released from her latest confinement, trying to ease back into society under the watchful eyes of her mother, probation officer, and sponsors of several 12-step programs. Despite admonitions from everyone, she is determined to track down Rat Face and find her sister's killer. Just when she thinks she has an ally, a cloud of suspicion is cast over that character, and she pulls back. Items disappear or are moved, causing Faith to doubt her sanity. Bad things keep happening, and Faith looks guiltier and guiltier. She doesn't know whom to trust\u2026not even herself.The author beautifully captures the raw emotions and chilling terror of the troubled heroine. This page-turner will keep you guessing until the end, because, as a reader, you won't know who can be trusted, either. And then you will be shocked.", "Star": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "A Deeply Emotional Thriller"}, {"Upvote": "3", "Review": "Christopher Greyson brings this story alive.  There are times when you find yourself thinking what would I do if this was me.  You turn page after page and find yourself holding your breath.

Faith Winters has spent the last 10 years of the death of her sister Kim, her friend Anna and her mother and her father in and out of psychiatric hospitals.She has been released and her mother brings her back to her hometown.  You turn each page thinking ok I have this figured out, only to find you have no idea.  If you have read the Jack Stratton series the author uses the same skill of writing in this book.

I didn't like the main character very much - she seemed to make every mistake and bad choice possible, and she wasn't very likeable, which is a problem with a first-person narrative.  While her actions, decisions and unpleasantness may make her a more realistic character, (I'm not a fan of \"Mary Sues\" either), it makes for a frustrating reading experience as we watch her make one bad choice after another - sometimes even the same bad choices multiple times!  A lot of people like this book, so your mileage may vary, but I doubt I'll read another book by this author any time soon.", "Star": "3.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "The main character is very frustrating, and annoying."}, {"Upvote": "3", "Review": "Along with being a thrilling suspense novel, this story tells about the deeply personal path of a young woman who is moving through the most difficult transition of her life.

As the sole survivor, she had spiraled downward into depression, alcoholism and mental illness.  Just released from a mental institute, she is going home to face her family, friends, past and most importantly, herself.  This story was thoughtful.  It was disturbing and deeply emotional.
