However I was always confused at what was going on at times but after reading the books everything makes so much sense now. I honestly liked the books more than the movies and although they are similar the books have way more content and details in them. So if you loved the movies I would 100% suggest getting the books.Speaking of the books I got the paperback version and they are beautiful. Although they are simple and the covers are one plain color per book it still has that sense of style and simplicity. They covers and case are thick and well made. Although their were points in the books where the words were slightly faded I still has no problem reading them.I'm not even going to talk about the story since just trust me when I say its one of the best series ever. I have never read or even considered reading a series twice but I honestly think that I might read this one a second time that's how much I liked it.So if you liked the movies and aren't sure about reading the books I would say go for it and get them since you wont be disappointed.

I did a ton of research and decided upon this version (ISBN 116-1749849-2513827), illustrated by Alan Lee and published by Harper Collins in June 2014  (I am adding these details because the Amazon.com site does not make it clear what this version is).  Please note that this particular printing is NOT available in the US but any Tolkien or LotR devotee should not be deterred (Frodo wouldn't have been!).  I must say that this is the finest published one-volume version of the LotR that I have ever laid eyes upon, and is well worth every penny.  It includes approximately 50 high-quality color illustrations by Alan Lee, which even for a 30-something like me makes the reading experience exceptional.  The front and back covers are made of durable, high-quality cloth (as shown), with a strong and handsome turquoise binding.  The pages -- not just the illustrations but the entire book -- are glossy and made of \"whiter\" paper than you generally find, the margins large, and the typeset easy on the eyes.For those who care about such things, the printing is based on the 2004 corrected text, with even further corrections.  There are updated introductions/forwards by Wayne G. Hammond  & Christina Scull, authors of the authoritative \"LOTR Readers Companion,\" as well as by Douglas A. Anderson, who provides a detailed publication history of the Lord of the Rings.  The full appendices are included.Two-page red and black maps of Middle Earth and of Gondor/Rohan/Mordor adorn the front and back covers, with a map of the Shire before the first chapter.  Also present are other essentials such as the Doors of Moria and the Tomb of Balin.  The only drawback is that the facsimile pages of the Book of Mazarbul was not included, which I found to be surprising and a bit disappointing Also, the ring inscription and the Gandalf \"rune\" are printed in black rather than silver and red.  Probably the main issue is the clear plastic slipcover, which is barely bigger than the book itself, and it is difficult to slip the book back inside it after taking it out.  You are more likely to scuff the corners of the book.

Couldn't find one, so I finally broke down and BOUGHT the Kindle one-volume edition. And the answer is: Yes, the table of contents is all bundled together at the beginning, as opposed to having a separate T-o-C for each \"volume\" (stop sneering, I've seen other one-volume e-books where you have to skip through the whole first section to get to the table of contents for the second section). More importantly, the T-o-C actually works. That's right, I can go straight to any chapter by tapping that chapter on the T-o-C (again, other e-books had a static T-o-C where no amount of tapping would take me anywhere and I had to keep flipping pages to get to the chapter I wanted). Everything else seems to be functioning without problems. Dictionary, highlighting, synching between my Kindle and my phone, etc., all work perfectly.

Tolkien's rich tapestry changes with one's perspective, yielding new designs and colors from the vantage point of age and experience.  However, after a reader has come to know the work intimately, it becomes fun to experience some extratextual analysis from a scholar who loves the book as much as you do!  That's just what this annotated edition of The Hobbit provides.Douglas Anderson has provided rich marginal annotations, presented alongside the original text of the story.  These include references from whence Tolkien borrowed many of his creations--offering a window into Tolkien's reading life, etymologies of words, and textual differences between the various editions of The Hobbit.  The first edition was most different from the others, particularly in the Riddles in the Dark chapter, the first meeting with Gollum, which unfolded much differently.  Other than that, I found it striking how similar the editions were, how little Tolkien would have changed and how in keeping with his broader works the Hobbit already was.  There is much biographical information about Tolkien.  For example, we learn that he loved the works of poet Francis Thompson.  The margin also includes many charming illustrations from all the illustrated editions of the Hobbit that have been done throughout the world.  There is a centerfold of colored illustrations in the middle, including all of Tolkien's own art related to The Hobbit.  I like Tolkien's the best in most cases!  How could one man have had so much talent?The appendix offers the most complete version of the Quest of Erebor, Gandalf's recounting of the story, previously published incomplete in Unfinished Tales(hence the title, duh).

The archaic word choice sometimes requires a trip to the dictionary (which the Kindle makes very easy).As for the Kindle edition, it is great. I found two flaws. Each chapter heading is a hyperlink back to the Table of Contents. I accidentally clicked them more than once. I just can't imagine who is flipping back to the Table of Contents like this.

Not that I have all of them, not even of the English speaking versions.  Naturally the artwork of the movie trilogy eventually led me back to wondering if I've missed out on some great newer book version, and I ended up buying 2 more copies, this being one of them.Since the words in every English edition of The Hobbit are all the same, having been written by the same guy, it's the extras like the artwork, the commentaries, the bindings and the what-nots that may lead you to love one edition more than another.I must admit there is a lot to like about this edition.  Principally the annotations, which very much like the annotated Alice in Wonderland continue upon every page, with fascinating stuff not found in the actual text of the novel.  But the illustrations are also quite good.  From the standpoint of illustration alone, I think my favorite remains the 1984 edition with illustrations by Michael Hague.  Hague's illustrations were hardly on every page, but neither were they sparse.  What makes them nice is that they take up the full page, they are in color, and they are scattered about from beginning to the end of the book.In The Annotated Hobbit, besides the wonderful annotations, there are a large number of <alas> black and white, and partial-page drawings by various artists.  The drawings are quite good (and I am sure would be absolutely splendid in color and full-page).  Thankfully though this is NOT ALL.  In the center of the book are 8 full color pages of illustrations by 7 different artists.  Mostly they are two illustrations per page, and mostly they are Tolkien's own, but nicely supplemented by the visions of 6 other skilled artists.I guess, all things considered, this might be the nicest overall edition I own.  One can always wish for MORE full-color illustrations, and indeed I seem to have fully lost track of one other, really luxuriously illustrated though soft-backed edition.

He will spend pages and pages discussing the landscape and geography, or the minute details of a character that is only present for a few moments in the story...

In no way should it be considered simply as the prologue to The Lord of the Rings. Tolkien draws heavily upon his scholarship of Old English and other Germanic heroic poetry in composing this flawless gem. He also explores and gives reign to his passion for the study and invention of languages. Written at the commencement of the events that witnessed Hitler's (read the Necromancer) rise to power in Europe, The Hobbit offers a new hero more in the mold of mid-twentieth century humanity, the accidental, if not reluctant burglar/adventurer who discovers his potential for courage and self determination as the (many) opportunities for learning and growth arise during the course of his journey, the request to restore the ancient treasure to Thorin Oakenshield and his twelve companions, by wresting it from the clutches of the evil dragon, Smaug . Bilbo Baggins' moral code rejects the premise that success is based on possession of wealth. Several times he rescues his companions using his own wit and strength of character. he acquires a sword, which he learn to wield against foes like the cannibalistic Gollum and the omnivorous spiders. He acquires and dispenses treasure during the course of his year long journey there and back again. He eschews cupiditas, the lust for treasure (which St. Paul identifies as the radix malorum, root of evils) that motivates almost everyone else in his narrative, except magical folk like Gandalf and Beorn, and heroes like Bard. He does keep his ring of power that he discovered in the Goblin Caves beneath the Misty Mountains, and does not return it to Gollum, but hey, nobody is perfect.

The book really flows well and does a nice job of developing characters and their relationships up until the end.  The entire novel builds suspense around the Dwarves and Co retaking their home and their eminent meeting with the fiery beast of Lonely Mountain.  However, I felt there could have been a bit more in the parties interaction with Smaug and with his demise.  It seemed rushed and forced a transition into the conflict at the end of the novel.  As much as it may surprise people who have read Tolkein before, I think he could have spent some more time developing Bard, the Master, and the whole story surrounding that particular area of Smaug's desolation.  I didn't really feel connected to the people and their problems.  The end of the story made up for what I feel are some shortcomings leading up to it.  I liked Thorin's turn and the interactions with the Elves and men.  I liked much of what Gandalf had to say and his part at the end.

The hobbit tells a fantastic story of adventure, danger, friendship, and courage, and serves as a prequel to the even more immersive and epic book series, the Lord of the Rings. This book shows that even the littlest of people can be the biggest heroes. I loved this book. It is set in a large, detailed, and lore-filled world that made me feel like I was there while I was reading it. The book also has many likable characters. The Hobbit starts out showing the life of Bilbo Baggins, a hobbit. A hobbit is much like a human. The differences between a human and a hobbit is that a hobbit only stands about 4 feet tall, and all hobbits have long and curly hair. One day while minding his own business, a wizard he knows named Gandalf the Gray shows up with a party of 13 dwarves, led by Thorin Oakenshield. While everyone eats dinner at Bilbo\u2019s house, he finds out that Gandalf volunteered him to help in their quest to retake their home in the lonely mountain, which was taken from them by the dragon Smaug. Bilbo initially declines the offer to join the party, but changes his mind the day after they leave, and he catches up with them. The group embarks on a long journey through the misty mountains and mirkwood forest, making enemies and allies along they way.This book introduces many characters. Bilbo Baggins is a Hobbit who like nothing more than staying in the comfort of his own home and smoking his pipe. These qualities become evident throughout his adventure, as he grows very homesick. Perhaps his best quality is his courage, which shows, as he sticks by everyone until the very end. Gandalf is also a great character. He is a 5,000 year old wizard, and throughout those 5,000 years he has grown very wise and powerful. He knows all the ropes of Middle Earth, and is always there to offer some wisdom or fatherly advice.The author, J.R.R. Tolkien has a somewhat lighthearted and quirky way of writing. He always takes the time to explain things in the story. He also has built up one of the best fantasy worlds in all of literature, and has a way in his writing that makes your feel like you\u2019re there. The Hobbit (and also Lord of the Rings) is set in a land called Middle Earth. It is filled with forests, mountains, and fantasy creatures of all types. Middle Earth is a fantasy world, and, like other similar fantasy worlds, everything is somewhat primitive. While there are big and beautiful structures and cities in Middle Earth, there are no technology or electricity. The main races; elves, dwarves, and mortal men, all have unique cultures. In conclusion, I believe that The Hobbit is absolutely worth reading. It is a fantastic journey of bravery, friendship and courage, that is set in a beautiful, massive, and lore filled world.
