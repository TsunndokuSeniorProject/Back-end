I have trouble with books where the main character is not someone I particularly like. But, I gave this one a shot. I was pleasantly surprised. I couldn't help but like the curmudgeon. It's not a deep-thinking book. It's there for entertainment, to make you 'feel' emotions, to transport you to another place and another life. Therefore, I give the book five stars for being exactly what it claims to be--a story about one man and the circle of friends that he makes despite his grouchy personality. I liked the backstory with the wife (even though I thought the author went too far with the tragedy heaped onto this always-optimistic woman). I bought the audio book to listen when I couldn't read and the narrator was flawless. I've heard some pretty bad narrators lately from best-selling books (Miss Peregrine's for example), but this audio book was very well done. I have one gigantic bone to pick with the author. 59 years old is not 89 years old. Fifty-nine years old is when most people are in the apex of careers--before retirement and also having a lot of knowledge and experience to help them in their career fields. The 50-somethings in my office know what an iPad is, how to use computers, have the latest cell phones, and are pretty up on all the new tech gadgets because they are the ones that can afford them! There was no reason why the author couldn't make this a lot more believable by making the main character 79 or older. There was nothing to prevent the backstory being set further back. The whole time I was reading, I had to make myself forget the character was supposed to be 59. For godsakes, the President of the United States is 56!!  I wonder why the author chose such a relatively young main character to act like my grandfather would.  But, if you can overlook that weird decision, the rest of the story is very well done and very entertaining.", "Star": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "Pretend Ove is 79"}, {"Upvote": "437", "Review": "There is a part of me that didn't think I needed to review A Man Called Ove because so many people have read it at this point, but I have talked to a few who have not, hence my desire to write this review.I will admit that I am entirely on the Ove train!The book is about a man, named Ove, who is the angry neighbor that we all seem to have. He complains about everything, has put up signs around his neighborhood with rules about what should and shouldn't be done, and feels there is a proper place for everything. He is not a friendly guy to say the least.Into his life walks or rather drives a family who are to be his new neighbors. He doesn't bother to get to know their names and calls them the pregnant one and the lanky one. After an accident with the lanky one, Ove is forced to help this family, complaining the entire time.Throughout the book Ove also speaks to his wife, complaining about the neighbors, the rule breakers, and how much he misses her (very minor spoiler). During interludes within the narrative, we read about how Ove became Ove. I will say by the end of the book, a bunch of dust was flying around the room and some got into my eyes.The first thing to write is this book is funny. Ove is quite the character and how he treats people is hysterical. He just doesn't care what he says or how he says it. He simply wants order in his world and has lived that way for all of his life. The way he expresses himself becomes incredibly funny.It is also a tragic story. Backman interweaves the two (funny and tragic) quite well and doesn't make it overly heartwarming. This could have easily become a book with the sentiment that we don't know people's past, so don't judge them, but it isn't. Ove is an ass in his past too and sometimes with reason. Backman keeps it level with just enough to make the reader fall for Ove.The great thing is this is a book that pretty much anyone and everyone can (and will) enjoy. I recommended this one for book clubs and discussion groups. Grandmas will like this as well as middle aged men. Ove is simply a good book.I gave this one 5 stars.", "Star": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "A Book for everyone"}, {"Upvote": "14", "Review": "In case you\u2019re one of those few who haven\u2019t heard about this book, here\u2019s what it\u2019s about in a nutshell: a curmudgeonly old man is prevented from killing himself multiple times by neighbors who are needy and people to refuse to obey the sign that restricts parking in the residential area of his small neighborhood. It\u2019s like the movie Up, only with more people that are adults, and more character. Take this paragraph for example:\"For more than fifteen minutes he stood waiting for her at the station in his tight-fitting suit and his new-polished shoes. He was skeptical about people who came late. 'If you can\u2019t depend on someone being on time, you shouldn\u2019t trust \u2019em with anything more important either,' he used to mutter when people came dribbling along with their time cards three or four minutes late, as if this didn\u2019t matter. As if the railway line would just lie there waiting for them in the morning and not have something to do.\"Every sentence in this book is imbued with characterization and style; every word is a brushstroke in the painting of Ove as not only a curmudgeon, but an (spoiler alert!) orphan, a loving husband to a wife who was paralyzed and rendered infertile by a drunk driver, a principled man, a hard worker, a dedicated Saab driver, and one of those loyal-to-the-death-but-you-wouldn\u2019t-know-it-to-talk-to-him kind of people.And, unlike most adult-genre books, especially ones about old people, there is something interesting or amusing or soulful on almost every page.

Backman sketches each scene with deft, bold strokes and yet a light touch. Ove's curmudgeonly approach to the world is akin to an oyster whose crusty shell protects the pearl that grows within. His neighborhood is a rainbow of quirkiness. Backman pokes fun at small town bureaucracy with the \"man in the white shirt,\" and wannabe urbanites with the \"blonde weed wearing sunglasses\" and \"her damned mutt.\"'  He meets his match in a scruffy stray cat that moves in uninvited. The tiny \"Pregnant Foreign Woman\" inserts herself into Ove's life and doggedly pulls him out of his shell. We can all relate to Ove's need for order in a world of chaos and his desire to shrink into his shell when he's been hurt. We're all reminded that the best things in life happen when unlikely people are thrown together in unexpected situations to produce uncommon results.

I was interesting in the book because of recommendations from friends and its place as a Best Seller, but it's not the kind of thing I usually read. All the same, I have never been so touched by a book that I had to immediately sprint to the internet and share my feelings.Ove is grumpy and awful and the first two chapters left me frowning and upset, wondering who would want to read a book all about someone so unhappy. But minutes later, I was deeply enthralled with the story of Ove. Backman has a unbelievably skill, a heartwarming talent to weave Ove's story through different timelines and a completely breathtaking array of events. I mean it when I say I COULD NOT put this book down. I had to know more about Ove and his life, and I was not disappointed. I am left here with a heart that is full from Ove's story, a heart that breaks for an old (although not that old) man called Ove who somehow found his way into my soul and proceeded to deeply and proundly speak to me about the nature of loss and love and honesty.Each and every character Backman has created has a story to tell, and each of them finds a way to tell it through Ove's eyes. Every second of this book was something refreshing and touching and completely overwhelming. I am unlikely to ever forget what an utterly fantastic book this is, and what a thoroughly talented writer Backman is.

I enjoyed reading it, and am looking forward to the Tom Hanks movie that is in the works for this book.  I felt that the author had a unique approach to his book in that he jumped back and forth across time quite a bit, telling the reader a bit about the present, and then explaining a bit about the past.  (I can\u2019t wait to see how they adapt this to a movie...????). In this way, the reader is slowly able to understand the \u201cbackstory\u201d of Ove, and understand why he behaves in the way he does.  As another reviewer mentioned, there is sort of an underlying current that Ove is probably somewhere on the spectrum of Autism, but the book does not specifically point this out.  However, his background probably influences the behavior to some extent, too.  The translation is very well done, and as someone else already mentioned, the humor is very well preserved across the languages.  You could almost imagine it happened in America, except that the money is in \u201ckronor\u201d.A few less than positive comments, although not enough to dock more than one star.  First, there is a lot of cursing in the book, although half of it is basically British cursing, and quite a lot of it adds to the humor.  It didn\u2019t really bother me, but just keep it in mind if you have a child that wants to read it and you are particular about language.  There is no sex or anything like that.  Also, I felt that some of the characters were overly stereotypical, and some not necessarily vital to the plot.  I would say maybe a modern social issue or two were injected into the story that maybe could have been left out to avoid a controversy.  However, it was not overbearing.  I also felt like a violent event near the end of the book was a bit sudden, to the point of not really going along with the general feel of the book. Like...\u201dWhere did THAT come from???\u201d  I almost felt like the author possibly took a break after writing 3/4 of the book and then came back to finish, because the general feel of the book, to me, changed slightly near the end, and I felt like the coherence of the story struggled at that point.Overall, however, the book was fun to read and was a neat mixture of comical and sad/serious.  It gave a good message about giving people a chance to get to know them before judging them, and also that you never know what someone has gone through in their past.I do think it will make a fantastic Tom Hanks movie.

Ole, the protagonist, will always be a clear image in your mind because of his peculiarities.Ole wants to be left alone.  He wants to converse with and think about Sonja, his deceased wife.  He wants people to follow the rules.  He wants order and routine to guide his life.  Uninvited interruptions and improper behavior are not acceptable.  When all these parameters are suddenly violated, Ole\u2019s life becomes, in his mind, unlivable.  He walks around in a huff even as he plans ways to do himself in.Parvaneh, a very pregnant Iranian woman, her husband, and two little girls move in next-door and Ove\u2019s structured world collapses around him.  She\u2019s cheeky, her husband is inept, and the little kids are annoying.  Ove doesn\u2019t like little children anyway.  Then a mangy cat takes over his serene home life and his best friend, who is sometimes his biggest enemy, becomes deathly ill, turning his wife into an Ove slave master.  Her doesn\u2019t like cats, either, and his friend\u2019s wife is becoming tiresome.  None of it is good for Ove.  When will it all end, allowing Ove to join his wife, wherever she is?The author involves his reader in every Ove tribulation.  It\u2019s highly enjoyable companionship albeit with an unwilling escort.  The writing, although unconventional as mentioned, captures the reader in its simplicity as it creates a world of complexity that creates havoc to a simple man of principle.  Ove\u2019s mumbling is memorable, as are caustic encounters with authority.I predict that you will take this book to your heart.

The protagonist, Ove is not your average, well loved book character.  He is an angry, short tempered, senior citizen that has definitely not moved into the 21st century.  He has basically been a loner since his wife died, and her passing did nothing to improve his disposition.  He follows rigid rules and expects everyone else to also follow them.  However, one day a young couple moves in to the house next door and shakes Ove's world up.  The wife is very talkative and very pregnant and on their first meeting she manages to plow down Ove's mail box.The young woman always seems to somehow overlook Ove's cantankerous  moods and talk.  Despite Ove's repeated attempts to avoid these people, the woman manages to befriend him,  Well, sort of befriend him.  This story is centered around this odd friendship.  There is plenty of things both of these people will learn about themselves, as well as each other.

I read some of the \"look inside\" snippets and was prepared to be underwhelmed.  But others in her group loved this book, and I'm with them.  The look inside snippets just don't do it justice.  I see this as a book for hopeless romantics - a great love story.  It's just not the kind we're used to.  Ove loves in spite of all his instincts to the contrary, and finds himself a hero and helper of anyone in need, again in spite of himself, and yet also because of who he is.  He is a man who loves rules, as long as he gets to make them up, but who hates with a passion the thoughtless rules of local government bureaucrats (the white coats).  After the death of his wife - his one true love, Ove is a man who wants to end it all, in a neat a tidy way of course, but he just can't seem to get the job done.

In Swedish writer Fredrik Backman\u2019s charming first novel, those routines are disrupted with increasing frequency by a varied cast of men, women, and children, to the point where Ove finds that he can\u2019t even carry out the seemingly most straightforward of his intentions.

The characters in his neighborhood keep interrupting him and he's pretty cranky about it all.  He is a person who sees things pretty black and white and has all his life - though his wife was not.

By the end of the book, I was in love with the characters and would have wanted to live with all of them as well. I don't know if they were based on real people, but the author really did a good job of creating characters that leave an impression. 3. Writing humor is very, very difficult, and Brogan's humor was refreshing and truly funny. I re-read some of the more clever lines in hopes of remembering them, and that's saying something for all the reading and writing I do. 4. A strong plot supported by interesting subplots that made sense and moved the story along. It wasn't face-paced nor did it drag. The momentum was consistent and everything came together in the end.I had the advantage of reading this book after one that tried to be funny but wasn't. There is a distinct difference.

There she meets Des, 36yo Scottish doctor, and an offbeat courtship/relationship ensues.This was a pretty quick read. Although it wanted to be really funny, it came off more as ridiculous in my opinion. I've read other romances where I actually laughed out loud (some books by Sophie Kinsella, for one) but this was not really one of them. However, it was still an enjoyable read--Des was totally HOT and a nice guy without being a wuss or a control freak--best case scenario.Sadie JUST skirted the edge of being one of those heroines who says, \"I don't know why he would like me, I'm such a mess\" and you find yourself agreeing with her. She pulled back just enough between the ridiculous acts of craziness that I wasn't totally annoyed with her. Although, strangely, I never really got a sense of what she looked like. Brown hair and eyes, and she denigrated herself at every turn. But others said she was beautiful, even her ex and he was a total narcissist who would probably never be caught dead with anyone rating less than a 9. She said she had worked out like crazy to try to \"help her marriage\" before the divorce so her body was great, but a few pages later, she'd be saying how she had to stand up straight and suck in her gut when Des was near. She just never came into focus.There's a bit of sex in the book but none of it is graphic or even detailed. Even so it didn't bother me. I would have liked to have seen more of Sadie and Des as a couple among other people. It seemed like almost every time they were together and happy, it was in private. Any other time they were shown in public something ridiculous happened. Ridiculous was a running theme in this book. When they went sailing with Des's friends, it was the only time they were out among others that some kind of zaniness didn't occur. Truthfully, I spent the whole chapter waiting for her to fall in the water or something.In any event, the reason I decided to write this review is because if I had known before reading what I found out on THE LAST PAGE I would not have bought the book:SPOILERS*********************************There seem to be whole chapters missing in the end. Sadie never has any kind of real understanding or communication with her mother. It was like her mother was just a one-dimensional prop to show Sadie what she could turn into, without explaining why or how she got there. At one point, Sadie's aunt sums the mother up in one line--someone must have disappointed her at some point and it made her not trust anyone. Could she be any more vague??We don't find out if Sadie's aunt will be okay. Although, that vagueness didn't bother me as much as the first.BUT, the biggest problem for me, was the fact that AT NO TIME, not even when Des comes back and tells Sadie he needs her and she makes him \"flustered\" does he EVER say, he loves her. And she doesn't either. As a matter of fact, Sadie says a couple of times that she isn't in love with him, or she might be falling for him. The only time she actually says she loves Des, is when she's lying to her ex.I was so floored. It was bad enough the author waits until the last 2 friggin' pages to get them back together. But then to not even reach the finish line (in these books, the L word is the finish line IMO), was completely disappointing. I was so annoyed, I reread the last few pages to make sure I hadn't missed it. But--no! He never says he loves her.END SPOILERS******So there you have it--ridiculous zaniness with some amusing side characters and a hot leading man but, in the end, unsatisfying--for me, at least.", "Star": "3.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "Would have been a four except for one, BIG problem"}, {"Upvote": "19", "Review": "My summer reading goals include some historical fiction titles and literary classics, so I like to add some light mysteries and pool reads to the list.

I read it while on vacation and although the overall story was OK, there was too much emphasis on the character's episodes of self doubt and insecurity. I get that she was treated badly by her first husband and had self doubts, but this aspect of the story was overdone. After the first couple of self doubt episodes I skimmed over them to get to the real story and this made it a very quick read. Although larger than life and very eccentric, some of the supporting characters were fun. The author is good at writing dialogue but their stories would be better if there was more depth. I probably wouldn't buy this author's books again unless I read a review which told me their work had evolved a bit more.One comment; the author obviously doesn't know much about cats and dogs. The descriptions of the animals in the story lend me to feel they have little experience with animals and don't care to. My suggestion for future books is they leave animals out of the story. Animals have as much character and in some cases more and better character than some people, but as with people, you have to take the time to get to know them. They like people, develop from the treatment they receive from others and in the case of domestic cats and dogs; the way people treat them is directly proportional to how they behave.", "Star": "3.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "A very light read with a couple of fun characters"}, {"Upvote": "8", "Review": "Sadie Turner had the house, the two kids, and the successful husband.

So is the fact that this novel has received more than 2,400 customer reviews on Amazon. That is Stephen King- and Dan Brown-like numbers. Brogan, a new author, has developed a huge following in short order.In Crazy Little Thing, we meet Sadie Turner recently burned by a cheating husband. Stung, short on confidence, and lacking a plan, she visits her quirky aunt Dody's pink clapboard lake house in Bell Harbor, Michigan. This is a place where no one knocked before entering or locked their doors. Sadie is drawn by the nostalgia and comfort, \"The scent of hot sand tinged with tanning oil and lilacs reminded me of carefree summers, back before I cared about damaging UV rays and toxins in the lake.\"Her plan is to escape men but that is not to be for both romantic and humorous reasons. Suffice it to say there is some dating with a \"dreamy\" doctor and more than a few absurd mix-ups reminiscent of an episode of Three's Company. Brogan employs an overriding metaphor throughout relating to cleaning up clutter. As such, she provides Sadie with a new and convenient career that allows her to create order from life's frequent chaos.The supporting characters are there to help Sadie too including a psychic advisor who says, \" We can't control events in our life, Sadie. Sometimes we can't even control our reactions. But the harder we fight against the waves, the more exhausted we become. Control is an illusion, you know.\" On the lighter side Aunt Dody is described as \"a tsunami in fuzzy slippers\". Dody is full of eccentric musings like wishing her husband had fixed the screen door before he died years earlier.It is definitely a light beach read. And while the dialogue is too clever by half and the ending a bit too clean, it will add to a sunny afternoon or pass a rainy day more pleasantly.

Aunt Dody is totally crazy and messy, and drives Sadie (who is a neat-freak) totally nuts.

At least at the beginning of the book.  But Ms. Brogan was merely laying a solid foundation.  I'm so glad I persevered as this story was unlike any romance I've read before.  Most romance novels deal with two people meeting/connecting, falling in love...hawt intimacy then breaking up, and after working out their issues, getting back together...usually.  But I especially liked this story as it dealt a lot with moving on after a divorce...healing from that stressful situation and how this main character, Sadie Turner, simply \"deals\".  And this story was so much more...it was about the journey and the arrival.POSSIBLE SPOILER:After a stressful and ugly divorce from her philandering husband, Sadie Turner heads to her Aunt Dody's home in Bell Harbor, Michigan, with her two children, for a much needed summer vacation.  She simply needs time to vedge and heal.  Sadie is insecure and vulnerable as she comes to terms with the wasted years she devoted to an uncaring man.  She has a poor self image and an even poorer outlook on life in general.  Her ex and his oppressive treatment of her for eight years makes Sadie second guess just about everything...but most importantly, ever committing to another relationship...ever.  Until she get's to know Dr. Desmond (Des) McKnight.Des is everything opposite of what Sadie has been accustomed to.  He's cordial and polite...he's kind, patient, sincere and caring.  When he shows more than a casual interest in Sadie, she finds it hard to believe (she does, afterall, have trust issues).  I loved Des.  He's the epitome of the perfect, non-arrogant alpha male.  A major \"rawr\".. yowza factor.This story was such fun to read...at times it had me laughing so hard I had tears streaming down my cheeks and my hubby going \"what?  what??\"...(and I'd have to stop and explain)...I loved Aunt Dody...a loving free spirit and Fontaine who's antic's and vernacular wit had me rolling in the aisles.If there was a downside to this book (for me) it would be that character descriptions sort of \"trickle\" in as you read the book.  The Author doesn't stop and devote a paragraph or three in just describing a person...descriptions filter in through dialogue and narrative...which isn't a bad thing...but can be distracting when you're trying to get into the plot.  I was often distracted, wondering what color eyes, or hair, or size, or height so-n-so had/was when I could've been concentrating more on what was happening at the moment.

Strong emotional dimension that the reader will easily connect with and become emotionally invested with in little time.  Deep tacit messages of healing, starting over...the journey and the arrival of finding that one special person in your life.

{"Comment": [{"Upvote": "19", "Review": "Madeliene L'Engle's \"Wrinkle in Time\" was one of the few young adult books that I actually read when I was a young adult.  I loved it then and have read it repeatedly in the past 40 years. My current passion for graphic novels and adaptations led me to this version by Hope Larson.Unlike some graphic novel adaptations, Larson had to abridge this story to some extent.  The other issue I had with this book was that the characters did not appear as I had envisioned them.  But the former was a necessity and the latter was a matter of personal interpretation, and neither detracted from the quality of this book.The adaptation follows the story of Meg and company closely.  Larson chose a difficult book to illustrate.  Characters such as Aunt Beast and IT might be better left to the imagination.  While the art is good, I would have liked it to have used as much color as the cover.My original intention was to reread L'Engle's version before I read this adaptation, but graphic novels draw me into them and don't let go until I have made it to the last page.  It has been at least 10 years since I last read \"Wrinkle,\" and it may be best that I didn't read it right before this book; I didn't make direct comparisons of descriptions and dialog, and that probably made this graphic novel more enjoyable.Looking at Hope Larson's work, I see that she collaborates on original stories and has others illustrate them. Even though I don't see myself reading Larson again, I would recommend her work to children or young adults.  Like \"Wrinkle\" her other works seem to include the important questions that good juvenile and young adult literature should ask.---------A note about reading this on Kindle:  This is the third graphic novel I have read in an electronic format.  One book was a Kindle enhanced version of \"Trillium,\" which had an option that allowed for swiping from frame to frame instead of page to page.  There was not enough opportunity to zooming in on the frames to make the reading easier.  In addition, the material was presented one page at a time instead of in a full-spread format to see opposing pages at one time.  This prohibiting seeing splash art as it was created by the artists.There was an improvement in \"Will 'o the Wisp,\" published in Adobe Digital Editions format.  There was an opportunity to zoom in as much as desired, but I found bouncing back and forth between full-page mode to see the art and zoom mode to be able to read the words was somewhat cumbersome.However, I would have loved to have had either zoom option with \"Wrinkle.\"  This Kindle book version did not let me zoom in on any of the individual frames, and so I actually had difficulty reading the text at all.  If I hadn't already had much of the story and dialog memorized from frequent reading of the L'Engle's book, I would not have been able to read it, and would have asked for my money back.I will hesitate reading other comic books and graphic novels in electronic format in the future, unless I know that I will have the ability to read the text in addition to seeing the art in double-page format as intended by the authors and artists.", "Star": "4.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "I loved it then and have read it repeatedly in the ..."}, {"Upvote": "13", "Review": "<3 \ud83d\udc97Absolutely LOVE it\u2763\ufe0f\u2763\ufe0f\u2763\ufe0f We have a 7, 9, 11, & 15 year old all reading it with us and THEY ALL LOVE IT\u2763\ufe0f Wish I would\u2019ve bought this sooner\u203c\ufe0fThis book is not word for word.

As a small girl, I would voraciously read more or less anything that was placed in front of me, from cereal boxes to a well-loved dictionary.  My grandparents loved introducing me to books that my mom loved as a kid, and one of my favorites was A Wrinkle in Time.I don't think I need to explain the story, but it is one of the best gifts a clever, perhaps slightly strange kid can receive.  The book stresses the importance of valuing yourself, both your faults and your strengths.  It reminds us that the ways we differ are just as important as the ways we are the same.  Perhaps most important for me, it tells us that home is what (and who) we make it.  It's just a gorgeous story, and one that other, far more concise folk have summed up.This adaptation, by the wonderful Hope Larson, is simply fantastic.  Much of the language is very much the same as in the original L'Engle, so it has very much the same feel.  I'm re-reading the original now, and the first few chapters are more or less the same in tone and feel.With regards to the art, I am totally charmed!  I love how Larson indicates color and movement.  A personal favorite is when Meg mentions Calvin's eyes being blue.  The whole book is blue, but when I looked at Calvin in that panel, they looked brighter.  It was beautiful.  Overall, I feel the art was exceptionally faithful to how I imagined the beautiful and fearsome aspects of the book.  Like others, I found IT to be particularly enjoyable.  I also want to stress how much I loved Mrs. Who in this version.  She never resonated with me the way Whatsit did as a child, but as an adult, I've found Who to be more my speed.  After all, communicating with the words of others -- It truly is easier sometimes, is it not?Perhaps I would not love this version as much were I not a lifelong fan of the book.

{"Comment": [{"Upvote": "1", "Review": "I very much enjoyed Kristin Hannah character development and story. This book is written better than many books about WWII. The reader experiences the struggles and fear of those living in a Nazi occupied country. I am very, very troubled however. When I read about Isabelle organizing an escape route for airmen whose planes were shot down in France and then escorting them safely to Spain with the assistance of reluctant Basque, I had to stop because I clearly remembered reading this before. I vaguely also remember a black white movie or documentary about this. I searched and found the once read story of the Belgium, Andree de Jongh who actually did what the fictional character Isabelle did in the novel. Much, much, much of the book parallels de Jongh's true story - the description of the heroine; the number of people (118 by de Jongh and 117 by Isabelle) escorted through this escape route: this escape route having a code name (Nightingale in the book and Comet in real life); the description of the airmen's instructions on the train and staying behind the heroine when they walked in German occupied cities; de Jongh's/Isabelle father executed by firing squad; the reaction of the airmen to this female who was going to be the one who to lead them out of France; de Jongh's/Isabelle's invisibility to the Germans because she was \"just\" a woman: collaborating with the British to fund the escape of airmen from France; de Jongh's/Isabelle's capture in the Pyrenees by the Nazi's then interrogation and Nazi's disbelief and rejection of the idea that a woman was capable of doing this; and de Jongh's/Isabelle's imprisonment in Ravensbruck women's concentration camp. Why am I troubled? I searched the book, several interviews with the author and Ms. Hannah website and there was no mention of specific name \"Andree de Jongh.\" Hannah acknowledged on her website that her search led her to \"a story of a young Belgian woman who created an escape route out of Nazi occupied France.\" I strongly believe that the author should have dedicated, credited or acknowledge the name of Andree de Jongh in the book where it was easily visible to the reader. de Jongh is as invisible to the author as she was to the Germans and in a book that celebrated the bravery of women during war. Was Vianne's character based on a brave woman who also deserved bold recognition?

The author skillfully paints a stark picture showing the extreme differences between the ways each sister manages to cope. The unimaginable hardships they endure are described in excruciating detail, making this reader cringe in fear and revulsion while at the same time, ensuring that said reader will not stop reading.As I sat reading this book in my home with all the comforts I have grown up with, I was reminded that this 21st century American lifestyle must never be taken for granted.

Anyone who has read more than a smattering of what has been published about World War II is sure to have encountered something about the French Resistance. It takes courage for a contemporary writer to undertake yet another book on such well-traveled terrain \u2014 and surpassing skill to succeed in crafting a fresh and moving treatment of the topic. Kristin Hannah has done just that in her novel, The Nightingale.The French Resistance, writ smallHannah is certainly not the first writer to spin a tale about the topic through the experiences of one person (or in this case, two), but she is surely among the most successful. The Nightingale is the story of two French sisters, Isabelle and Vianne Rossignol. (The surname means \u201cnightingale\u201d in French.) Isabelle, the feisty and headstrong younger sister, is determined to serve her country when Nazi Germany invades France in May 1940. She is just eighteen and single as the war begins, having been expelled from a long string of boarding schools. Vianne, ten years older, is a married schoolteacher and the mother of a bright eight-year-old daughter. The two sisters live very different lives through the six years of war, apart most of the time but intersecting at crucial points along the way. Isabelle personifies the Resistance. Vianne and her daughter stand in for all those in France who lived and suffered at home. Both characters are well-developed and credible.A culture of crueltyUnlike some authors, Hannah does not paint a picture of all German soldiers as monsters. Also, though she celebrates the heroes of the Resistance, her treatment of the French people in general is far from kind. The collaborators who dominate the French police are merciless; one in particular proves to be a Nazi at heart. But two Nazi officers play larger parts in the story: a Wehrmacht captain and a colonel in the SS. Though a proud German and at times a willing participant in the Nazis\u2019 vicious treatment of French civilians, the captain has a gentle and compassionate side. By contrast, the colonel embodies all the mean, vindictive traits of Hitler\u2019s chosen few, the \u201cAryan\u201d men of the sadistic enterprise known as the SS.In a world dominated by reason and compassion, the colonel described by Hannah would be considered grossly exaggerated \u2014 a figment of the author\u2019s imagination. Sadly, the portrait is all too realistic, as there are innumerable examples of such monsters throughout the history of World War II. The SS fostered a culture of cruelty: these were not men who were \u201cjust following orders\u201d \u2014 they were willing, even eager participants in the wanton violence and murder that Hitler\u2019s minions wreaked on untold millions of Europeans. Yes, six million Jews were murdered; as a Jew by birth and a visitor to Auschwitz just twenty years after the end of World War II, I\u2019m intensely aware of that fact. But so were five million other Europeans, not to mention the tens of millions of others who died as soldiers or suffered intense privation of the sort experienced by Vianne and her neighbors. The Nightingale helps us understand the breadth of the horror visited on the world by Hitler and his cronies.About the authorA former attorney who turned to writing full-time, Kristen Hannah has written 22 novels over the past quarter-century.

'The Nightingale' was the perfect book for me to get to know her body of work.The novel tells the beautiful, tragic, and triumphant story of two sisters, Vianne and Isabelle, who live in France during WWII and make starkly different but sometimes similar choices in coping with the war and its effect on their lives and on their beloved country. From the first page, I was hooked. Kristin Hannah's writing style isn't complicated, nor is it pretentious. It's beautiful and straight-forward, simple but enthralling, while concurrently teaching the reader unsavory lessons and consequences from war time. Both her protagonists and many minor characters in 'The Nightingale' are strong and admirable, while also showing a duality of vulnerability.I love historical fiction, especially those with WWII as a backdrop so the story and plot charmed and fascinated me from page one, and I felt it was done well. I loved many things about the novel but as a classically trained chef and a gourmand, one thing that many readers might miss or might not appreciate as much, was Hannah's accurate and delicious description of food and cooking that Vianne does throughout the book. It was surprising but wonderful to read it being integrated into the story in a way that was convincing. It makes me wonder if the author herself is an avid cook or perhaps she simply loves and appreciates gourmet food. Either way, this was a device and technique that was minor, but very effective and pleased me tremendously.Also wonderfully done was Hannah's propensity to write the book in such a way that it was almost cinematic, as if she intends to or knows that the book will eventually be adapted into a screenplay for a feature film (as of the writing of this review, a feature film is in development). In other words, the characterizations and descriptions are rich, immersing the reader deeply into the mind of the characters both major and minor, and vividly into the plot. While reading, I could see the searing pain and harrowing decisions the sisters had to make in order to survive. In this vein, I was emotionally wrought and gutted while reading chapters 22 and 23, in as much that I had to take a short break before continuing onto 24. The story is about two sisters but it's also about war, don't forget. Heavy stuff, made more wrenching knowing that although this book is fictional, many things that took place actually happened to real people during WWII.As much as I love the book, there are two negatives I must mention. First, is that the bravery and heroism of Isabelle was too heavy handed, cajoling. In the beginning of the book, her character is annoying, arrogant, and impetuous, with a too-big-for-her-breeches attitude. Later on, Hannah transforms her into an almost mythical, herculean, Mount Olympus Goddess type heroine whose actions although believable, were too forced, for the purpose of dramatization. Perhaps the author was trying hard for us readers to like the character of Isabelle after her initial behavior in the beginning of the book.This wasn't necessary in my opinion because even with less heroicizing, I would have still liked her. Not as much as I liked Vianne, but I would have still liked her character nonetheless.Another plot point that I felt could have been shaved off a bit was the love story subplot between Isabelle and Gaetan. It played throughout the book, which was tolerable, but it was too sentimental, maudlin, to the point of cloyingly sweet. I'm not a major fan of \"love at first sight\" type plots, nor do I like too much romance in my novels. I did like their love story but I would have preferred less of it overall. Yes, people fall in love during times of war, but the over use of plot devices like \"I will go to the ends of the earth for you,\" or \"our love is all that sustains me\" type details don't please me. To be clear, these lines are not in the book but it felt like they were. The Isabelle Gaetan love story parts of the book were too drawn out and made the pace of the book stall. Which pains me to say because the novel's overall pace is excellent.Despite those the two pet peeves, I felt 'The Nightingale' was an excellent read. The decisions that both sisters had to make, especially those by Vianne, are layered and thought-provoking. It makes me wonder what I would do in the same scenario, given little choice. My reading experience with the novel was wonderful and though the book is more accurately 4.75 stars, it deserves the full 5 stars for the effort. Highly recommended for historical fiction, WWII, and strong women fiction fanatics.", "Star": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "Beautiful, Tragic, and Triumphant: With Some Annoyances"}, {"Upvote": "2", "Review": "The Nightingale is a realistic fiction novel depicting a time when France was occupied by Nazi Germany during WWII. It tells the story of two sisters, Vianne and Isabelle who lost their mom when they were too young. You could also say, that in a way, they have lost their father too who was a broken man after the Great War. When the war begins, Vianne is working as a teacher. She's married to Antoine and they have a daughter, Sophie. Isabelle, the younger sibling, is only eighteen. She's impetuous and adventurous.Before long, Antoine is sent to fight in the war, leaving Vianne and Sophie behind. Isabelle soon joins her sister, after her father sends her away from Paris. Vianne and Isabelle have never been close. Their differences have always been noticeable. Vianne thinks of herself as weak and worries about their survival, while Isabelle speaks her mind and wants to join the fight. She wants to be part of the resistance. Their lives become more complicated when a German captain is sent to live with them. Vianne tries to keep her head down and be inconspicuous. Isabelle, on the other hand, knows she can't stay with Vianne without putting her and Sophie at risk. When the chance to join the resistance comes, Isabelle makes up an excuse to go back to Paris. Here is where the story becomes impossible to put down. The sisters' tribulations, losses, heartbreak and the always present danger captivates the reader.\u201cA broken heart hurts as badly in wartime as in peace.\u201dI believe The Nightingale is a story that should be read by everyone. Kristin Hannah does a great job in detailing the horrors of the war and their consequences. At times, I felt like my insides were being ripped apart. I knew it couldn't end well for them. Or at least not for both. The end was bittersweet. I would recommend having some tissues around. I was not a sobbing mess like I was with her other novel, Firefly Lane, but it was close enough.I hope the movie does this book justice. I hope to add it to prior masterpieces like Shindler's List and Life is Beautiful.\u201cMen tell stories,\u201d I say. It is the truest, simplest answer to his question. \u201cWomen get on with it. For us it was a shadow war. There were no parades for us when it was over, no medals or mentions in history books.

{"Comment": [{"Upvote": "58", "Review": "This was a terrific read!  Frazier takes us through the passages of Varina's life as a mirror to the life of the South during her years from youth to old age.  Frazier's depiction of the antebellum South, complete with the neurotic obsession of her soon-to-be brother-in-law's vision of a slave culture and her soon-to-be husband's unique relationship with his overseer/slave/friend, Pemberton, precisely defines what southerners meant by the term \"the peculiar institution.\"  Her flight southward is of course metaphoric for the flight of any southerners in the disastrous end of things for the Confederacy.  The vignettes along the muddy roads headed southward are excellent, and say much about what was to come for the South over upcoming decades.  I especially like the depiction of Varina as an ever more independent thinker and actor.  It's hard to imagine that the marriage to a repressed martinet like Jefferson was one of much joy.  And over time nearly all their children die.  Varina emerges as a woman who can stand apart from her world, evaluate it, see it for what it is, and maintain a dignity and an integrity.  I came away liking this woman, perhaps respect would be a better word.  And as a longtime student of the Civil War and its aftermath in Dixie, I found her an excellent cipher for its people and their travails.  Beautiful phraseology throughout.  Great story.", "Star": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "Varina's Life as a Metaphor for an Age"}, {"Upvote": "30", "Review": "Varina Howell was born into a Mississippi family whose economic status waxed and waned. At the age of 13, she was sent for one year to a girls' school in Philadelphia and returned home to be tutored by a lawyer/judge living in a cabin on her family's homestead.  Judge Winchester instilled in Varina a life-long love of books and trained her in both Greek and Latin for a life of the mind through the study of history, philosophy, poetry and mathematics.  As \"spinsterhood\" approached, at the \"ripe old age\" of 18, Varina was married off to the widower Jefferson Davis, over twenty years her senior and still eight years in mourning for his first wife.  Varina later noted, \"Back then, a good marriage did not require love: a good marriage meant security.\"  She planned to settle on the Davis Mississippi plantation, but her husband chose a political career as a member of the Federal House, Senate and finally Secretary of War. The couple lived in Washington, DC for over 15 years where Varina, because of her wit, charm and education, became friend and hostess to Presidents and Congressmen of the day.  After the Mexican American War, she refused to join her war-hero husband back in DC until he changed his will to make her the beneficiary of his estate.  She finally won her cause.  When the Civil War began and her husband became the first and last President of the Confederacy, she reluctantly moved with their children to the Grey House in Richmond.  She loathed Richmond and was never accepted by the local high society.  She viewed slavery as the \"strangeness of owning people\" since she treated \"help\" like members of her family.  She believed that the South was unprepared for conflict and queried of the Confederacy, \"Is it self-government or self-immolation we are testing?\"  As Richmond burned, she fled with her children and a few loyal servants toward Florida and ultimately planned an escape to Cuba.  It was not meant to be: Jefferson was captured and later imprisoned near DC for two years and she was \"imprisoned\" for a year in Savannah.  After the war, she lived mainly apart from her husband in Europe and with friends throughout the South.  Upon his death, she completed his memoirs.  She supported herself in New York City by writing articles for the New York World.  She befriended Julia Grant, wife of Ulysses Grant, and the women were often seen in public to promote further reconciliation within a healing nation. Varina openly asserted, \"The right side won.\"Frazier is a master wordsmith. He unwinds Varina's life backwards, from the end of her life forward, primarily using fictional conversation. Frazier's prose captures not only the lushness and false \"civility\" of the slave-propelled agricultural economy of the Antebellum South, but also the ravaged landscape and desperate population after Sherman's march to the sea.  Even better are Frazier's delicate forays into the psyches of post-war Jefferson and Varina.  The first reveals a delusional, old man failing both mentally and physically quite emotionally detached from his wife of almost fifty years.  The other is a person with a will of steel who fulfills her obligations, mourns the death of her children and creates a new life.  She wrote, \"It is a frightful thing to drop out of one's place in the world and never find it again..\" Thanks to a gifted author, the reader becomes acquainted with an important American feminist who was, in many ways, ahead of her time.", "Star": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "A Southern-Belle Bellwether"}, {"Upvote": "18", "Review": "This book was a true testament of what a man I never knew anything about was really like.

She was a woman way ahead of her time and never failed to speak her mind and question what she did not understand.

The author, Charles Frazier, previously wrote Cold Mountain, a Masterpiece, in my opinion. Often a novelist has that one outstanding book and all that follow seem inadequate, even those well done. With Varina, the author has accomplished his next great work! Difficult as it can be to weave real historical figures into the fabric of fiction, Frazier has done so, and in excellent form. For readers who have preconceived thoughts, that all of war was a simple concept, after reading this book, you may feel differently. The human, emotional weavings with passion and yet, leaving the reader to ponder and reflect without judgment. Stop and reread and repeat, the same paragraphs, for the nuances and beautiful structure of thought into words, is what I found myself doing. Frazier is the most eloquent writer of near prose I have found. He can turn a phrase so profoundly, you want to keep it with you. I often do copy them down.In these days of selective spending and the abundance of book selections, it is easy to be tempted by covers and advertising. Varina is a novel that will be a keeper and one you will recommend to friends.
