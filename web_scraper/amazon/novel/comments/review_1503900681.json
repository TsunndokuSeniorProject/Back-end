It's everything, love is. It runs the whole universe.\"A very sentimental tale that weaves heartbreak, familial love, agape love, philia love and  eros love with more than a dash of  mystical magic mojo. Some may say too sappy (and they would be right), some would say too predictable (yes that too) but overall it was sweet and light.It's the meringue of beach reads for the year.Our heroine Marnie can \"see things\" , but she can't see that being dumped by her husband of 2 weeks is really the beginning of her big, BIG life that has been prophesied over her by Blix (her fiance, nee husband, nee ex-husband's crazy aunt). Hope that makes sense. The both of them (Marnie and Blix) send out  vibes and receive them back, they kind of guide them to see who would be potential mates. Hence the Matchmaking moniker.Throw in the fact that you have neurotic mothers and MIL's, a pregnant hormonal sister who seems to have it all and a terminal illness. Whew, that a lot of stuff to cram into a book.This is book where you really suspend reality and laugh at the things that are obviously coming down the pike with more than a little foreshadowing. But I give the book four stars because it tugs at the heart and brings a little tear and some warm fuzzies too.Very mild potty language and some non descriptive sex scenes make this one you could pass along to your mom without worry.", "Star": "4.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "Love is everything.

No Sci-Fi.  No Paranormal.  No interesting horror.  Just like last month (which I passed on).  Determined to read an \"ordinary' novel if I had to, I closed my eyes and picked this one.  Turns out I'm pleased to have chosen this book.Blix, the strange Great Aunt.  My favorite character in a long time.  She was wonderfully eccentric and lovable.  The first half of this book was alternating POV's , which worked rather well.  It enabled the reader to get to know both main characters and their thought processes.  Because of Blix, I was sucked into the story more easily than I would have been if things had only been told from the Heroine's viewpoint.  Because Marnie (the ?Heroine?) didn't always appeal to me.  She was a bit too emotionally damaged, and she really didn't treat Jeremy (one of her love interests) all that well.There was family drama.  There was love gone bad (and good).  There was humor--I actually laughed out loud when Marnie and Patrick attempted to cook live lobsters. ( I hate to give a spoiler, but I will say that the lobsters won).  Through it all, Blix made the entire story worthwhile, even when she wasn't physically present.  And there was even just a touch of 'maybe' paranormal, which for me, made it even that much better.  Best of all, it's a complete story.  No 'Book 1'.  No cliffhanger ending.

She's engaged to the love of her life, Noah, and together they will create a stable, ordinary life. Yes, Marnie can see her future. The problem is that she's 100% wrong.Noah's great-aunt Blix only meets Marnie twice, but she instantly recognizes a fellow spirit, another matchmaker who can see the magic and love in the universe. She's also convinced Marnie has a big, big life in store. And it doesn't involve Noah. It turns out old Aunt Blix might have been onto something, because Noah and Marnie's marriage goes south before it even starts. Reeling from the break up, Marnie is shocked to learn that she's inherited Blix's house in Brooklyn. Just one problem: moving to Brooklyn doesn't fit into Marnie's plans. It also comes with an unexpected roommate-- Noah, of all people-- and several tenants who are struggling with their own relationships. Marnie is determined to sell the house and move back home, but, even from the grave, Blix has her way of making sure everyone discovers their destiny.This book was a bit of magic, a touch of humor, and a lot of romance. It reminded me of the chick-lit books that were popular 20 years ago but have become unfashionable, crowded out of the market by sullen women's fiction and creepy psychological thrillers. Let's just say I'm on board for the revival. I absolutely loved the author's sense of humor. And, yes, Marnie is a complete idiot most of the time, but you get used to it.

First is Blix\u2019s declaration to Marnie that she was meant for a \u201cbig life\u201d as opposed to the ordinary life Marnie saw for herself \u2013 being married, domestic bliss, a job, children, etc. But by \u201cbig life\u201d, Blix meant a life in Brooklyn in a charming brownstone with a collection of bohemian friends.

I found nothing especially \u201cbig\u201d about the life the author described.Secondly, it really grated on my nerves when Blix, and then Marnie, insisted on the introverted Patrick attending parties. The author made it seem like preferring to be around one person at a time versus lots of people as pathetically sad.  Only when he came upstairs to go to their parties was he deemed saved by their extroverted ways.  As an introvert, I found nothing wrong with Patrick preferring to hang with one friend at a time. I hate it when people insist that something must be wrong with me for not wanting to be around lots of people all the time.  This of course is my personal preference. I just saw these scenes in a different way than the author intended. I felt really bad for Patrick being forced to be sociable when he did not want to be.
