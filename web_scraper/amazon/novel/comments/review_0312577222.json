{"Comment": [{"Upvote": "1", "Review": "I very much enjoyed Kristin Hannah character development and story. This book is written better than many books about WWII. The reader experiences the struggles and fear of those living in a Nazi occupied country. I am very, very troubled however. When I read about Isabelle organizing an escape route for airmen whose planes were shot down in France and then escorting them safely to Spain with the assistance of reluctant Basque, I had to stop because I clearly remembered reading this before. I vaguely also remember a black white movie or documentary about this. I searched and found the once read story of the Belgium, Andree de Jongh who actually did what the fictional character Isabelle did in the novel. Much, much, much of the book parallels de Jongh's true story - the description of the heroine; the number of people (118 by de Jongh and 117 by Isabelle) escorted through this escape route: this escape route having a code name (Nightingale in the book and Comet in real life); the description of the airmen's instructions on the train and staying behind the heroine when they walked in German occupied cities; de Jongh's/Isabelle father executed by firing squad; the reaction of the airmen to this female who was going to be the one who to lead them out of France; de Jongh's/Isabelle's invisibility to the Germans because she was \"just\" a woman: collaborating with the British to fund the escape of airmen from France; de Jongh's/Isabelle's capture in the Pyrenees by the Nazi's then interrogation and Nazi's disbelief and rejection of the idea that a woman was capable of doing this; and de Jongh's/Isabelle's imprisonment in Ravensbruck women's concentration camp. Why am I troubled? I searched the book, several interviews with the author and Ms. Hannah website and there was no mention of specific name \"Andree de Jongh.\" Hannah acknowledged on her website that her search led her to \"a story of a young Belgian woman who created an escape route out of Nazi occupied France.\" I strongly believe that the author should have dedicated, credited or acknowledge the name of Andree de Jongh in the book where it was easily visible to the reader. de Jongh is as invisible to the author as she was to the Germans and in a book that celebrated the bravery of women during war. Was Vianne's character based on a brave woman who also deserved bold recognition?

What's THAT about, I thought. So I read the book, and now I know what the raves are all about. This book is one of the best, if not the best book I have ever read. Hannah writes like an angel. The book isn't a fast read, at least not for me, because I would go back and reread a sentence just to enjoy the mastery with which it was written. Hannah's style doesn't try to be high literature, but the result is. She writes beautiful scenery and background, but not so much as many authors do. Her characters, well, I felt like I knew them, like old friends, not without flaws, but perfectly developed.So I add my five-star review to the others. Read this book.

Exceptional writing, unique story line, complex characters. Which is why I gave it five stars.Now to the fun part. Why I didn't like this book. The honest answer is it made me feel too much. Now you're are probably wondering how can I not like a book like that? This book made me feel happy, sad, scared, grateful and a bit guilty as well. I was born to a generation and a country that didn't have to face the horrors of war. I hear about the destruction that wars bring in the news and I change the channel. Why? Because it makes me sad. This book teaches us how fragile life can be. One day you might be enjoying a beautiful day in the sun and the next something unimaginable might happen to you and the people you love.I didn't t like this book because it made me face my own inadequacies head on. How I should show the people that I love how much I love them more often. How I should treasure every minute that I am blessed to have them in my life.

This was not the case at all.The story focuses on alternating between two French sisters, who have a tense relationship which stems from childhood issues. Vianne and Isabelle are quite different from one another, and this offers readers the chance to follow both women on very different courses through the war.The pace of the book was relatively slow, but I think that supported the concept that the occupation of France was not quick.  It was long and drawn out, and the stress and reality of war broke many people. The slow pace also helped richly develop the main characters, as well as several supporting players.  It kept pulling me back in for more. There were a few times when I was thinking \"can anything more happen to them?\" And it did.The ending was amazing, and I shed several tears.  I hadn't thought much about how I thought the book would/should end, but of course I had a few guesses.

That \"little bird\" was, of course, The Nightingale, the immensely popular best seller by Kristin Hannah.Set in France during the German occupation of WWII, the story is about the lives of two sisters, Vianne and Isabelle, who struggle to survive during the darkest of times, under the harshest and most brutal conditions. The author skillfully paints a stark picture showing the extreme differences between the ways each sister manages to cope. The unimaginable hardships they endure are described in excruciating detail, making this reader cringe in fear and revulsion while at the same time, ensuring that said reader will not stop reading.As I sat reading this book in my home with all the comforts I have grown up with, I was reminded that this 21st century American lifestyle must never be taken for granted. History has a nasty way of repeating itself and the amenities we Westerners have enjoyed during the past 7 decades could be erased in the blink of an eye. Or the flash of a nuke. And I have to wonder how many of us would be strong enough to survive the way Vianne and Isabelle--or any of the survivors of that war--did.

Separately they make a stand against the invaders of their homeland, never losing sight of their desire for freedom even when it means their personal sacrifice.The book covers the gamut of the German invasion and the effects it had on the population - the hardships and atrocities that were a part of it.

Vianne is married to Antoine, whom she has loved and been loved by since she was 14 years-old. Isabelle has been kicked out of one boarding school after another.When news of war comes to France, Vianne remembers her father the way he was before the first Great War and how he was never the same afterward. Isabelle only remembers the man from after the war; the one who never wanted her.With Antoine called to fight, Vianne is left to care for their daughter, Sophie, when the Germans invade France. She has no idea how she will cope. Isabelle wants to fight for France. She wants to join the Resistance and do whatever possible to free France from the horrible Nazi regime.Differing dispositions and ideology separate the sisters, but as conditions in France turn into a real-life nightmare, each sister must tread her own dangerous path to survive the Occupation.This is now one of my favorite books of all time.

Anyone who has read more than a smattering of what has been published about World War II is sure to have encountered something about the French Resistance. It takes courage for a contemporary writer to undertake yet another book on such well-traveled terrain \u2014 and surpassing skill to succeed in crafting a fresh and moving treatment of the topic. Kristin Hannah has done just that in her novel, The Nightingale.The French Resistance, writ smallHannah is certainly not the first writer to spin a tale about the topic through the experiences of one person (or in this case, two), but she is surely among the most successful. The Nightingale is the story of two French sisters, Isabelle and Vianne Rossignol. (The surname means \u201cnightingale\u201d in French.) Isabelle, the feisty and headstrong younger sister, is determined to serve her country when Nazi Germany invades France in May 1940. She is just eighteen and single as the war begins, having been expelled from a long string of boarding schools. Vianne, ten years older, is a married schoolteacher and the mother of a bright eight-year-old daughter. The two sisters live very different lives through the six years of war, apart most of the time but intersecting at crucial points along the way. Isabelle personifies the Resistance. Vianne and her daughter stand in for all those in France who lived and suffered at home. Both characters are well-developed and credible.A culture of crueltyUnlike some authors, Hannah does not paint a picture of all German soldiers as monsters. Also, though she celebrates the heroes of the Resistance, her treatment of the French people in general is far from kind. The collaborators who dominate the French police are merciless; one in particular proves to be a Nazi at heart. But two Nazi officers play larger parts in the story: a Wehrmacht captain and a colonel in the SS. Though a proud German and at times a willing participant in the Nazis\u2019 vicious treatment of French civilians, the captain has a gentle and compassionate side. By contrast, the colonel embodies all the mean, vindictive traits of Hitler\u2019s chosen few, the \u201cAryan\u201d men of the sadistic enterprise known as the SS.In a world dominated by reason and compassion, the colonel described by Hannah would be considered grossly exaggerated \u2014 a figment of the author\u2019s imagination. Sadly, the portrait is all too realistic, as there are innumerable examples of such monsters throughout the history of World War II. The SS fostered a culture of cruelty: these were not men who were \u201cjust following orders\u201d \u2014 they were willing, even eager participants in the wanton violence and murder that Hitler\u2019s minions wreaked on untold millions of Europeans. Yes, six million Jews were murdered; as a Jew by birth and a visitor to Auschwitz just twenty years after the end of World War II, I\u2019m intensely aware of that fact. But so were five million other Europeans, not to mention the tens of millions of others who died as soldiers or suffered intense privation of the sort experienced by Vianne and her neighbors. The Nightingale helps us understand the breadth of the horror visited on the world by Hitler and his cronies.About the authorA former attorney who turned to writing full-time, Kristen Hannah has written 22 novels over the past quarter-century.

Rather, I'll simply point out what I loved and a couple minor things that I felt could have been lessened.To start off, I'll say that I am delighted that I discovered this book because it has made me realize that I must add Kristin Hannah into my list of favorite authors. 'The Nightingale' was the perfect book for me to get to know her body of work.The novel tells the beautiful, tragic, and triumphant story of two sisters, Vianne and Isabelle, who live in France during WWII and make starkly different but sometimes similar choices in coping with the war and its effect on their lives and on their beloved country. From the first page, I was hooked. Kristin Hannah's writing style isn't complicated, nor is it pretentious. It's beautiful and straight-forward, simple but enthralling, while concurrently teaching the reader unsavory lessons and consequences from war time. Both her protagonists and many minor characters in 'The Nightingale' are strong and admirable, while also showing a duality of vulnerability.I love historical fiction, especially those with WWII as a backdrop so the story and plot charmed and fascinated me from page one, and I felt it was done well. I loved many things about the novel but as a classically trained chef and a gourmand, one thing that many readers might miss or might not appreciate as much, was Hannah's accurate and delicious description of food and cooking that Vianne does throughout the book. It was surprising but wonderful to read it being integrated into the story in a way that was convincing. It makes me wonder if the author herself is an avid cook or perhaps she simply loves and appreciates gourmet food. Either way, this was a device and technique that was minor, but very effective and pleased me tremendously.Also wonderfully done was Hannah's propensity to write the book in such a way that it was almost cinematic, as if she intends to or knows that the book will eventually be adapted into a screenplay for a feature film (as of the writing of this review, a feature film is in development). In other words, the characterizations and descriptions are rich, immersing the reader deeply into the mind of the characters both major and minor, and vividly into the plot. While reading, I could see the searing pain and harrowing decisions the sisters had to make in order to survive. In this vein, I was emotionally wrought and gutted while reading chapters 22 and 23, in as much that I had to take a short break before continuing onto 24. The story is about two sisters but it's also about war, don't forget. Heavy stuff, made more wrenching knowing that although this book is fictional, many things that took place actually happened to real people during WWII.As much as I love the book, there are two negatives I must mention. First, is that the bravery and heroism of Isabelle was too heavy handed, cajoling. In the beginning of the book, her character is annoying, arrogant, and impetuous, with a too-big-for-her-breeches attitude. Later on, Hannah transforms her into an almost mythical, herculean, Mount Olympus Goddess type heroine whose actions although believable, were too forced, for the purpose of dramatization. Perhaps the author was trying hard for us readers to like the character of Isabelle after her initial behavior in the beginning of the book.This wasn't necessary in my opinion because even with less heroicizing, I would have still liked her. Not as much as I liked Vianne, but I would have still liked her character nonetheless.Another plot point that I felt could have been shaved off a bit was the love story subplot between Isabelle and Gaetan. It played throughout the book, which was tolerable, but it was too sentimental, maudlin, to the point of cloyingly sweet. I'm not a major fan of \"love at first sight\" type plots, nor do I like too much romance in my novels. I did like their love story but I would have preferred less of it overall. Yes, people fall in love during times of war, but the over use of plot devices like \"I will go to the ends of the earth for you,\" or \"our love is all that sustains me\" type details don't please me. To be clear, these lines are not in the book but it felt like they were. The Isabelle Gaetan love story parts of the book were too drawn out and made the pace of the book stall. Which pains me to say because the novel's overall pace is excellent.Despite those the two pet peeves, I felt 'The Nightingale' was an excellent read. The decisions that both sisters had to make, especially those by Vianne, are layered and thought-provoking. It makes me wonder what I would do in the same scenario, given little choice. My reading experience with the novel was wonderful and though the book is more accurately 4.75 stars, it deserves the full 5 stars for the effort.

It tells the story of two sisters, Vianne and Isabelle who lost their mom when they were too young. You could also say, that in a way, they have lost their father too who was a broken man after the Great War. When the war begins, Vianne is working as a teacher. She's married to Antoine and they have a daughter, Sophie. Isabelle, the younger sibling, is only eighteen. She's impetuous and adventurous.Before long, Antoine is sent to fight in the war, leaving Vianne and Sophie behind. Isabelle soon joins her sister, after her father sends her away from Paris. Vianne and Isabelle have never been close. Their differences have always been noticeable. Vianne thinks of herself as weak and worries about their survival, while Isabelle speaks her mind and wants to join the fight. She wants to be part of the resistance. Their lives become more complicated when a German captain is sent to live with them. Vianne tries to keep her head down and be inconspicuous. Isabelle, on the other hand, knows she can't stay with Vianne without putting her and Sophie at risk. When the chance to join the resistance comes, Isabelle makes up an excuse to go back to Paris. Here is where the story becomes impossible to put down. The sisters' tribulations, losses, heartbreak and the always present danger captivates the reader.\u201cA broken heart hurts as badly in wartime as in peace.\u201dI believe The Nightingale is a story that should be read by everyone. Kristin Hannah does a great job in detailing the horrors of the war and their consequences. At times, I felt like my insides were being ripped apart. I knew it couldn't end well for them.

The book takes place in France just prior to the start of WWII. The two main characters in the story are Vianne and Isaebelle who are sisters. The story first starts off with an older lady packing up her possessions in her house. While she was packing up her items, she came across something that reminded her of the war and what her family had encountered. She then tells the story throughout the whole book. I agree with Vianne's choices on the personal sacrifices she made to keep her family safe. My biggest issue in the book was when the author used reoccurring descriptions to describe the pain and sorrow the characters experienced. Although there were a couple of flaws in the story, The Nightingale is still one of my favorite books. I now have a broader view of WWII and realize the hardships the French people had to face.

Others, my favorites, invite readers onto the field to participate in the action. Hannah does that. A phone or doorbell ringing is annoying. Of course, the best thing about reading is the words will wait patiently for a reader to get back.

It will pull you right in, and you will want to keep reading until the very end. The setting is France under German occupation in World War II. Little by little the Nazis tighten their grip. Initial politeness turns to barbarity. Nazi collaborators live comfortably and have plenty to eat. The rest of the population is close to starvation. Jews are fired from their jobs and then eventually rounded up for deportation to concentration camps in Germany.We often hear about what men do in war, how they fight, their bravery and sacrifices. However, this is primarily the story of the women left behind and the choices they make. Isabelle Rossignol, as a young rebel in her 20s, joins the French Resistance and devotes her life to helping downed allied airmen escape on German patrolled trains and then over the Pyrenees to Spain. She is called \u201cThe Nightingale\u201d from the French, \u201c\u201dRossignol\u201d.  The Nazis, who finally interrogate her, do not believe that this young girl is the mastermind of the Nightingale operation. Vianne Mauriac\u2019s husband is in a German prison. Since she has room in her large home, Le Jardin, a Nazi officer is billeted in her home. She wants so much to be safe and tries to make the best of her situation. But soon she sees German cruelty and cannot turn her back on what she sees. She risks her life and the life of her daughter to save 19 Jewish children from the Nazis.The relationship between the two sisters is also at the core of the novel. They struggle with feelings of abandonment, betrayal and lack of trust.  Deep within is the love they have for each other, and love finally wins. Each in turn seeks love from others. Isabelle\u2019s love relationship with Gaetan, a partisan, is poignantly told. Vianne\u2019s love for her husband Antoine and her attraction to the German officer Beck is there, as well.This is an historical novel, and Kristen Hannah did a good deal of research. The author based some of her novel on the true story of a heroic, young Belgian woman, Andree de Jongh (nicknamed \u201cDedee\u201d) who set up the Comet network to help downed airmen (as well as civilians) escape the Nazis. The 600 mile Comet network included a series of safe houses, rides on German patrolled trains, dangerous border crossings and finally the journey across the Pyrenees to Spain. Dedee was very m  uch like Isabelle in the novel.Kristin Hannah left her law practice in Seattle to become a full-time writer.

Left behind by the men who fought for freedom, these sisters take two different paths but learn:  \u201cIn love we find out what we want to be; in war we find out who we are.\u201d  Hannah\u2018s control of detail and emotive language enables us to empathize with Isabella and Vianne as they struggle to survive the atrocities of WWII.The resistance of these sisters during WW II propels us through the narration. Through Vianne, we become observers of the physical, emotional, and psychological challenges inflicted on the women of Carriveau as the war drags them through a quagmire of cruelty and survival.  When Vianne must prepare for her first winter alone with her daughter, Sophie, she realizes \u201chow perilously balanced her survival was\u201d as she begins to chop wood.  \u201cEvery chop reverberated up her arms and lodged painfully in the muscles of her shoulders.

I can see some of the points of the negative reviews, but they absolutely do not warrant such scathing reviews.Here is what you need to know if you are thinking about reading this book:(1) It is slow going at first, but keep reading. I had a hard time for the first 100 pages. It wasn't that the book wasn't good or interesting, but it wasn't one of those books that grab you immediately and you can't put it down. It wasn't until I got past the first 100 or so that I couldn't put it down.(2) You will have a love-hate relationship with some of the characters. You will feel torn with between being frustrated but still understanding why the characters act the way they do. To me, these are the kind of characters I want in a book. None of the main characters are purely good or purely bad. They are normal everyday people who act immature, selfishly, do things out of fear, and then surprise you by their changes and actions. This is how people in real life are. That isn't unrealistic. In fact, it is the picture of who we are as humans. It reminds me of when you hear someone is going to be a first time parent, and you first thought is \"THEY are going to be parents!?!\" But in the end, when that baby comes and those unseemlying new parents buck up and then you are surprised to see them turn their life around because of that little new life. I imagine being in the middle of a war zone is similar in that you don't get to leisurely grow up anymore. You might fight the inevitable changes at first, but in the end, you don't get a choice about growing up. You do what you need to out of necessity.(3) At some point, your preconceived notions will be challenged. The word Nazi brings many things to mind. Mostly darkness, depravity, and horror. This book obviously did not change that, because obviously there aren't even words to describe the evil that occurred during WWII. It is hard to see anything beyond that when talking about WWII, especially having been to Auschwitz. However, The Nightingale somehow helped me piece together who Nazi soldiers were in a more tangible way. They were people with wives, children, parents, etc. Many did unspeakable things, but what were they thinking when they did them? Were they ashamed or proud? Putting this into prospective made the Nazi agenda even more bizzare to me. How the eff did this happen? These were normal people who bought into propaganda so much so as to start a world war. It is terrifying.(4) It isn't, and doesn't have to be, some literary mecca. It is an easy to read story that makes you think, especially if you haven't read many books about this era. It may spir on to learn more about the topic. Personally, I sought out more books after reading this because I wanted to learn more about the facts. To me, this marks a good book. Not advanced sentence structures or words not frequently used everyday. It encourages you to engage with the underlying story, the characters, and learn more about what this aspect of WWII was like.
