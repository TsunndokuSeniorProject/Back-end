{"Comment": [{"Upvote": "8", "Review": "You know a book is good if it stays with you a few days after reading it.  The author, without being at all obvious about it, leads us through a story that has many levels and explorations of what it means to be \"captive\".  Captive to a slave owner, captive to a concept, captive in an exhibit.  It looks at what it takes to be truly free.This is my first book by Edugyan.  It won't be my last.", "Star": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "Impressive"}, {"Upvote": "2", "Review": "Interesting that this novel ends in Africa, albeit the northern portion of the continent. Dahomey out of reach, beyond the veil. Still so far from Home. I look forward to reading Esi Edugyan's other offerings.", "Star": "4.0 out of 5 stars", "Title": "Riveting"}], "Star": "4.6 out of 5 stars", "Name": "Washington Black: A novel", "Format": "Format: Hardcover", "Price": "$18.32", "Author": "Esi Edugyan"}
