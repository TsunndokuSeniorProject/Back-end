Action, suspense and steam. 4.5 Stars~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~It seemed like it has been quite a while since the last installation of this series, so it took me several chapters to really get back into the story. I kept getting this feeling that I was missing something and sure enough there was a book in between that I did miss.I was getting fed bits and pieces of the story and was able to patch together the general plot of what it happened to the team after the first book. Moving forward"}, {"Review": "4.5 StarsI\u2019ve loved every book in this series, and I\u2019m thrilled that we get not only one romance, but two! I\u2019ve been waiting for Kate and Colt\u2019s romance since they\u2019ve been featured in bits and pieces with every installment and I was thrilled they got equal page time with Natalie and Scott. Both romances were amazing! Explosive chemistry and a bit of angst as they each must sort the past out, and find out who was responsible for the attack on SEAL Team Nine. I do think this series is best to read"}, {"Review": "I have been devouring this series as soon as each book comes out and after the way the last book ended, I was definitely excited to finally have Scott's story!After their unit was double crossed and only a few men survived, these Navy SEALs are forced to relocate across the globe and hide until the mole is uncovered. Scott feels responsible for his team's ambush, especially since his girlfriend in the Pentagon might have had something to do with it. Natalie was adopted from Russia when she was y"}, {"Review": "I guess this was the last one then, I mean the story wrapped up so it has to be. Though we did not get all the lost guys, a shame. Who knew what fun things they were up to while hidden.The pieces are falling together in this one. Who was behind the missile strike that killed half the team? You will find out. But first, romance!Scott loved his girlfriend. The girlfriend who warned them so he could save half his team. The girlfriend who is a freaking spy!? Yes he was not happy to learn that. Who c"}, {"Review": "I love this series, but, I don't like waiting so long between books. With an overarching plot it is difficult keeping track of all the characters and plot developments that are important to finding out who the ultimate baddie is. That said, \"Out of Time\" is a great story and Scott and Natalie are a couple caught up in situations they never thought could happen to them.A team of Navy SEALs goes on a top secret, black-op mission to Russia and disappears without a trace. Neither the Russians or the"}, {"Review": "My FAVORITE of the series!!! I've been dying for Colt and Kate to get their long-awaited HEA and I wasn't disappointed in this final Lost Platoon novel. This sexy, action-packed series has been a roller coaster of a ride and wrapped up wonderfully in Out of Time. I've been sucked in to the suspenseful plot and hot romances, so it's bittersweet knowing this is the end of this team of Navy SEALs. I can only hope we get more romantic suspenses from Monica McCarty in the future!"}, {"Review": "At the heart of it, \u2018Out of Time\u2019 is one of assumed betrayal, even more assumptions that the protagonists have of each other and the elasticity of truth, all of which revolve around a botched mission, a missing SEAL team and questionable loyalties. By and large, I did like Nat/Scott\u2019s story though I found the secondary couple of Colt/Kate more compelling in the whole narrative arc of lies, deceit and vengeance as the characters pursued some kind of justice for themselves and for the dead men. De"}, {"Review": "I didn't realize this was part of a series when I picked this one up. That said, it wasn't too difficult to get in to the story. I felt for a few chapters that I was missing something but once the action got going, I was sucked into the story. This one is about Natalie and Scott. They have lots of issues to overcome and some truths to be revealed. Not much more I can say here without revealing the plot. Needless to say, there have been some wrongs and finding out if it truly was Natalie who betr"}, {"Review": "A short while ago I read the second book in The Last Platoon series and quickly grew obsessed with a certain couple. Imagine my surprise when I found out that my favorites were not the main characters in this final book. I went into it just a bit sad, but Monica McCarty did such a bang up job with this book that the sadness lasted for like 0.1 seconds. Bonus, I got TWO amazing romances in Out of Time. Second bonus, one of the couples was my favorite couple!What I have loved about these books are"}, {"Review": "This was the best in the series!

There was a lot of talking about and searching for clues to what happened in Russia. It picked up for me about a third of the way in. I like Natalie and understand why she did the things she"}, {"Review": "\u00a0I didn't read the first 2 books in the Lost Platoon series, so the first couple chapters I was a little lost and playing catch up. By chapter 4 I was completely hooked on this story. Natalie and Scott had such a great story and so much love between them. The story inside the story Kate and Colt was so sweet. I will definitely be reading the other books in this series.\u00a0"}, {"Review": " A gripping and intense story 5 starsBefore I start to wax lyrical about this fantastic book - let me first say that this is the third book in the Lost Platoon series. It does stand alone but had I read the other books before this one, I would have been a bit more up to speed with who the supporting characters were and what the general background of the whats and whys of the mission of SEAL team nine. I\u2019m assuming these stories fit in nicely to the timeline of this one and characters from those"}, {"Review": "This isn't one of those series that you can jump into on book #3 and be able to enjoy the story with no background. It's actually a little hard to get into at first because the reader is expected to know things that happened in previous books and time keeps jumping forward to glimpses of events that take place in previous volumes. It helps long-time readers place where/when the story takes place, but it confused me and kept me from really forming any kind of attachment to the characters.The plot"}, {"Review": "Out of Time is the third novel in Monica McCarty\u2019s romantic suspense series, The Lost Platoon. The series revolves around a platoon of Navy Seals, Seal Team 9. This volume is centered around platoon leader, Scott Taylor, and his love interest, Natalie Andersson, also known as Russian spy, Natalya Petrova. Scott\u2019s sister, Kate, and her ex-husband, Colt Wesson, are also featured in the story. Both relationships are complicated, but the primary and supporting characters are all fully developed, as"}, {"Review": "Another great story in what I\u2019m guessing is the last in this series. Scott, the commander of the team, tracks down his late girlfriend\u2019s friend only to discover that she is his girlfriend,Natalie, who was supposed to be dead. Natalie was the spy who caused the deaths of his team. Naturally it\u2019s never as simple as it seems. Along the way we also get to see Scott\u2019s sister,Kate, who is CIA, come to terms with her ex-husband,Colt, who was one of the survivors of that Team. Everything was wrapped up"}, {"Review": "Packed with danger, intrigue and suspense, Off the Grid, delivers a punch in the Lost Patrol series and leaves you wanting more. I wish the platoon wasn\u2019t so dispersed, so they could have more of a group dynamic to the stories. I want to be pulled in deeper to them as a group. That being said \u2013 I loved the mystery, romance and edge to this book."}, {"Review": "4 starsABOUT THE BOOK: Release Date December 31, 2018 A team of Navy SEALs goes on a mission and disappears without a trace--they are the Lost Platoon. With his men scattered to all corners of the globe after a disastrous secret op in Russia, Lieutenant Commander Scott Taylor is trying to find out who was responsible for leaking the information that killed half his platoon.

Scott was calling my name since I've read about the secret source who told him about them being set up in the first book. As book #2 developed I was having an idea of what was to come in this book, and I was not disappointed!So, there's A LOT going on in Out Of Time. Scott discovers Natalie's alive, and that she betrayed him. We also get to know about their relationship before Team Nine was brutally attacked by russian missiles.

McCarty ratchets up the suspense even higher in this tense third installation, OUT OF TIME, with a Russian sleeper agent.The investigation of the saboteur and resulting destructi"}, {"Review": "First, let me preface this review by saying that I did not read the first two books in the series, and perhaps I should have. Right off the bat, I had trouble getting into the story because the first few chapters are spent on reintroducing characters and plot lines from what I'm assuming took place previously in the series. It was a lot to take in. That said, I honestly enjoyed the book as a whole.I loved the chemistry between Scott and Natalie, even if the \"failed Russian spy\" storyline didn't"}, {"Review": "Of the three books in the Lost Platoon series by Monica McCarty, Out of Time is probably the one I enjoyed the most. I found it more fast paced than book two (Off the Grid) and slightly more compelling than book one (Going Dark), though maybe that's because all pieces of the plot finally started fitting together and I got answers for a lot of things the previous books left unsaid.  Natalie's actions irked me a bit - though she sort of redeemed herself at the end, all that running away and not tr"}, {"Review": "I loved the characters in this series, especially all the alpha men; Dean, John, Colt, Scott, swoon swoon swoon swoon. This third book (and I'm assuming last book in the series, since the big mystery was solved) wrapped everything up and I'm glad we got to see where people ended up. The plot was good and I'm a sucker for a good SEAL romance.BUT the writing was extremely repetitive. It started to grate on me. Not only was it repetitive in rehashing things we already knew, but descriptions were al"}, {"Review": "The third in the Lost Platoon series, Out of Time was a very good read. Having not read the previous two I was still able to follow along with was happening in this story. The author does make reference to previous events, but it was easy to follow. Out of Time never had a dull moment, it had a lot of action, suspense, government espionage and most importantly, romance.We actually get two romance story lines, but Scott and Natalie's is the main one. Circumstances drove them apart and it was the"}, {"Review": "Scott Taylor was willing to break the rules of his SEAL team when he fell in love with Natalie. But then a mission went wrong that left half his team dead, and all signs point to Natalie as the culprit. As he tries to root out why someone wanted his team dead, he tracks down Natalie to get answers, but confronts the problem that maybe things aren\u2019t as black and white as he wants them to be \u2013 and maybe he still has feelings for her.

I almost missed out on some good reading if I hadn't been able to see past the beefcake type cover photo myself.The books are actually written with the worldview of the high level, elite special forces units, along with intrigue, deceit, betrayal plus LOTS of steamy, graphic sex scenes... Those are actually the least believeable par"}, {"Review": "More Reviews Here: Readers Live A Thousand LivesThis series has been a ride and I am so glad I finally have my answers. There were a lot of twists and turns along the way, but in the end this series delivered.This book did take me a bit to get into, which has kinda been consistent through this series, but once I get into the story I REALLY get into the story and devour the rest of the book.

This isn\u2019t a stand-alone book you can just read on its own. For the first 20-30% of the book I was mostly confused, trying to piece together what was actually going on. There was a back story that I had missed with not reading the first 2 books. I liked the storyline when I got to grip with what was happening. The story had a strong start but then kind of lost its flow in the middle. The last 20% was the best part for me. It was full of action an"}, {"Review": "I read the first book in The Lost Platoon series when it came out and I missed the release of the second. I don't think it mattered. This one wrapped the series up and it seemed that it did it much sooner than I expected. Book One followed one member of the platoon and I expected Six books to follow each of the six members. Did not happen. While I liked the characters the action seem rushed and the solution also rushed. At the conclusion some things were still up in the air.
