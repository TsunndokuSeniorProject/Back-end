I liked the dual storyline which converges later on in the story. However I did feel that the one with Reacher in it, looking into his \u201cfamily tree\u201d to be quite slow moving and a bit dry. The second story line with the two young people stranded finally at a more than creepy motel was the most interesting in the book.I like my characters wel"}, {"Review": "I\u2019ve been reading the Jack Reacher series since Lee Child wrote his first. How wonderful it is after finishing #23 in the series to say it\u2019s definitely one of my favorites!Jack Reacher, our 6\u20195\u201d ex-military hero is on a journey from Maine to California and decides to take a pit stop in Laconia, New Hampshire to check out his father\u2019s birthplace. Scanning through records at town hall and researching census from long ago bring him in contact with a lot of different characters - some nice and some"}, {"Review": "Lee Child returns with another Reacher adventure that takes things down some untraversed pathways, particularly interesting for series fans. When Jack Reacher sets out for California, he has high hopes about this journey. However, early during the trek, he ends up having to get out along the road in New Hampshire, where a road sign rattles in the wind. The town of Laconia triggers a memory for Reacher, which he soon recollects is Stan Reacher\u2019s place of birth, a father who taught him the steely"}, {"Review": "Past Tense is an okayish Jack Reacher. I never felt drawn into it unlike the earlier ones in the series. This could be due to Jack Reacher outstaying his welcome - there are only so many plots available given the context or it could be that with every story, Jack Reacher becomes more and more like a Superman-Ninja combination. And that is a nice segue into one of the indications that Lee Child is himself aware of it. There were two separate threads in the story which meet only towards the end. A"}, {"Review": "I really enjoyed Jack Reacher's latest foray into the world. So much so that I could not stop reading and knocked off most of it in one afternoon. One of the best in the series to date!There are a number of story lines going on in this one and a lot of characters, some good and some really bad - as usual! Also as usual Jack manages to get caught up in several different issues and has to fight his way out. He also discovers some amazing details about his own genealogy which he takes much more cal"}, {"Review": "Only for the already-devoted Reacher fans and then.... The challenge for Child on book #23 is that he's already written several books in which the bad guys do unspeakable things to children, are holding one or more entire towns or communities hostage by threats of violence to anyone who steps out of line. He's also written several books in which Reacher hooks up with the FBI agent investigating either related crimes or the targets of Reacher's interest. In order to avoid duplicating these plot p"}, {"Review": "My thanks to Random House/Ballantine and Netgalley for letting me read this arc for my honest opinion.It's actually been a few years since I've read Jack Reacher. I'll confess that when I heard that Tom Cruise was playing Reacher in a movie it kind of ruined the image. Of course, I first had to spit the vomit out of my mouth, and spend a few minutes cussing. It's not that I dislike Cruise, its just that I think he's human garbage. Oh, dear me! Well, look at my little rant. How embarrassing. Not"}, {"Review": "Oh, how I love this Jack Reacher series!I\u2019ve always felt the thinking of timing, speed, movement, sequences, and assessments was Reacher\u2019s. From previous books, I know Reacher has that internal clock and he just knows what time it is. And he pictures how things work out before taking action. In this book, I began to think that those types of thoughts were being applied to some of the other characters. I found myself wondering if it was because there were spoilery things (that I won\u2019t mention) go"}, {"Review": "Jack Reacher has apparently been thrilling readers for twenty years. No one told me. Although this is only my second Reacher novel (and its number 23 with a bullet), count me in as a fan. Reacher is an ex-MP who has taken to wandering the country, heading here and there for the barest of reasons. Well, he likes a puzzle and is curiouser than any ten cats. Along the way, Reacher always seems to stumble into trouble.

Let me just say - it was awful! I was so disappointed. The story line I found very far-fetched on both sides. I honestly kept thinking and hoping it would get better, but so sorry to say it did not. I was not shocked to see many one star reviews when I went to Amazon. I am not giving up on Lee Child's writing though, and I have a couple of his previous book"}, {"Review": "Perennial traveller Jack Reacher is journeying down to San Diego for some warm weather, his thumb is his ticket.

The books are quite formulaic and you either buy into the formula or you don\u2019t. He\u2019s the loner who arrives at a new town and happens upon some trouble, resulting in his brutally beating a few people and crushing some bones.

And in this, the 23rd book in the series, he gets plenty of opportunity to practice his considerable skill.The story begins as Reacher walks and hitchhikes near a remote and tiny town in New Hampshire on his way to wherever else the wind (or more accurately, any driver who gives him a l"}, {"Review": "They are all so good but this one is straight out spectacular. Telling you about the tension I felt reading this one!! I had to stop at some point after about page 100 to relax with some physical work exertions to get \"unwound\" and to distract myself enough to be able to swallow my own spit.

This book was different from Lee Child's other books and I liked it! There were two seemingly unrelated storylines going on and I spent most of the book trying to figure out how they connected. Also, the plot was not at all predictable and kept me guessing the entire time! Thank you NetGalley for the ARC! This was a great read and I would definitely recommend it!"}, {"Review": "More edge-of-your seat action from Lee Child. Jack Reacher once again finds himself in the middle of a strange situation.

Great story! ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Being that I\u2019m coming in fresh on a long running series, I had a little bit to learn about Jack Reacher. What I have gathered here is that he is one person you do not want on the wrong side of you.With a history of military and military police, Jack finds himself in a predicament as he begins his journey from Maine to San Diego. I love his theoretical mind and how he\u2019s able to think his way out of problems and issues.

Per his wrting style, the exposition is methodical. However, in PAST TENSE the build up is slower than usual due to the lengthy, picayune details. The reader can guess where this first storyline is headed early on and the (albeit slow) and steady build up piques the reader\u2019s curiosity and tickles the spidey-sense, which builds up the susp"}, {"Review": "Two mostly unrelated stories, based in Laconia, NH, that converge about three quarters of the way through to me in a seemingly forced manner. One is slightly interesting, the other an overused and completely predictable trope. Jack Reacher is hitchhiking from Maine to San Diego, and decides to go through Laconia, his father\u2019s birthplace to examine his roots. Very little can be found in the public records, except that it seems that Stan's predilection for justice was passed on to son, Jack.

Some are better than others in my view, and I think this is one of the best. It has the pleasing simplicity of the early Reacher books - the uncluttered landscapes, the quirky perspectives - and unlike some of the author's later books, which try to vary the formula by relocating Reacher to Europe, or going back too far in time, this one hits the ma"}, {"Review": "3.5 stars"}, {"Review": "Easily one of my favorite Reacher books to date.
