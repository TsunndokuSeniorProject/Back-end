A mindblowing, to-die for twist! A fast read that kept me intrigued from beginning to end, although the shocker came at the end. Wait......wait......what just happened?

This will still be an overall positive review, but I felt I had to include some honest thoughts here as well for those readers who may need their expectations in line like I clearly did. The premise here is simply incredible; we have a woman named Alicia Berenson who is"}, {"Review": "Teetering between a 4 and a 4.5Alicia Berenson is a famous painter who has been admitted to the Grove, a forensic unit in North London.

This book is the very definition of a page-turner. From the very first page I was seduced by the magnetic writing style of Alex Michaelides.Nothing is as it seems in this novel. This story is complex and mu"}, {"Review": "Whoa! This was brilliant! This book right here is the reason that I love psychological thrillers. This has become an overly saturated genre with every one taking a stab at writing these twisty little mind fucks but more often than not they fall flat. It takes a talented mind and writer to pull off a really shocking twist successfully. Alex Michaelides has done just that because I did not see that coming at all and for that I thank you! *claps hands* Alicia Berenson appears to have it all. She's"}, {"Review": "Silence speaks volumes. It may be the silence of reproach. It may be the silence of speechless shock, fear or guilt. It may be the silence of rage. Perhaps it is a watchful, patient silence. It may also be the silence of simply having nothing to say. After a woman murders her husband and refuses to speak, a therapist whose stock \u2013in-trade is speech is determined to uncover the motivation behind such a heinous act. This is a sneaky psychological thriller that left me at a loss for words."}, {"Review": "Promising to be the debut novel of the season, I decided to make this my first read of 2019! I am glad I did not wait any longer...Alicia Berenson was a famous painter, married to an in-demand fashion photographer, living what appears to be a life that others would envy...till she kills her husband by shooting him in the face, five times, and never speaks another word. Her only assertion about what happened is her self portrait, Alcestis, named after the tragic heroine of the Greek tragedy by Eu"}, {"Review": "Well looks like I\u2019m the outlier on this book as I have been reading many glowing 5 star reviews. Maybe I\u2019ve been reading too many thrillers lately. For me to love a thriller all of the characters have to be well developed and intricate to the story, the plot has to be a good one and have more to offer than just the \u201cthrill\u201d, or wow factor at the end of the book. I found the characters to be shallow and the plot seemed to run off in several directions throughout the course of the novel. I should"}, {"Review": "Having seen a lot of good reviews about this book I was in 2 minds whether to read it. sometimes the books that have the most hype are not always the best books and can be quite a disappointment.I was held captive and read it in 1 sitting.

The obvious scenario is that she shot him?Alicia was taken to a psychiatric facility called The Grove, where she has not spoken for 6 years. Will"}, {"Review": "Do you play chess? I don\u2019t, more of a tic-tac-toe aficionado TBH. But I\u2019ve always admired the ability to think 10 moves ahead when faced with a worthy opponent.

Well believe the hype, it is really that good. The very first chapter opens with Alicia Berenson standing in her living room covered in blood. There is blood on the walls and the floors and all over her. She is standing in front of a chair that her husband is sitting in, with his face blown off. He has been shot 5 times in the face at close range. His wrists and ankles bound with wire. Alicia is bleeding from both wrists that have been slashed."}, {"Review": "Jaw. On. Floor.There's that moment in The Silent Patient. The \"Wait, what? What??\" moment that you're so often promised on the jacket copy, or in blurbs stamped on the front, or--well, you know.You get promised it, but you don't really expect it. And as I was reading The Silent Patient, which takes a while to really start firing on all cylinders (which is not a plus for a shorter novel like this), I thought, \"Ok. It's a little sluggish, and if X happens, then Y will and then will get Z and--\"And"}, {"Review": "I just finished The Silent Patient and now I understand all the hype.

And something does happen, one of the players folds, just surrenders!! What does one do then?

And I was hyped. Ultimately, not even a well furnished quote from one of my favorite go-to-thriller authors wasn't able to save this mess. Even when sis snapped with a shocking and explosive twist I NEVER coming, I still was exasperated about the whole book overall. The writing.....wasn't really my cup of tea.

Though it got off to a slow start, the consistent build of intrigue kept me raptly listening. I generally don't \"do\" audiobooks but I was fortunate to win this in a giveaway. I have to say that this is the best audio book I have ever tried. Kudos to the narrators for not putting me to sleep! Overall, The Silent Patient was a clever psychological thriller with plot twists I never saw coming and really, that is the thrill of the thriller, isn't it?"}, {"Review": "This is an outstanding debut psychological thriller! I really enjoyed it and it kept me fascinated. Alicia Berenson is a happily married artist who loves her husband. Until she kills him. Or did she? Alicia never speaks a word after the murder so she was sent to a mental institution called The Grove. Alicia is The Silent Patient - she doesn't speak to anyone at all.

The Silent Patient was a very enjoyable book and a solid 4.5 stars. Alicia is a famous painter and seems to have it all-a beautiful house, wealth and a loving husband named Gabriel. That\u2019s why everyone was utterly shocked when Alicia is accused of shooting and killing Gabriel. Why would she kill her loving husband? To make matters worse, Alicia refuses to speak in her defense and is ultimately sent to The Grove-a secure forensic unit."}, {"Review": "I must confess; I have sinned. The Silent Patient is the reason I have sinned; the reason I was gluttonous. My sinning began at page one, yes - it was there that I found myself gorging, gulping, slurping down every sentence, devouring page after page until I reached the end. I know I should feel remorseful but the only feeling I\u2019m left with upon completion of The Silent Patient is that of pure satisfaction. The Silent Patient is a staggering, twisted, satisfying and savory read. It\u2019s yet another"}, {"Review": "Why I love itby AJ FinnSince Gone Girl conquered the globe in 2012, bookstore shelves have creaked beneath the weight of countless psychological thrillers. Another 44 were published in the past eight seconds alone\u2014and precious few of these novels actually qualify as psychological suspense. More often than not, they focus on an imperiled protagonist\u2014usually a young woman\u2014whose psychology is neither nuanced nor particularly \u2026 well, particular. We might rattle around in the heroine\u2019s head, but abse"}, {"Review": "This unpredictable psychological thriller examines the relationship between psychotherapist Theo Faber and his patient Alicia Berenson, who becomes mute after she is hospitalized for murdering her husband. This riveting book explores the broadening and narrowing of lines between doctor and patient and how, at times, they even intertwine. This shocking debut will be the breakout hit of the new year and will keep readers guessing until the very last page."}, {"Review": "An excellent, slow-burning psychological thriller; sharp, clever and with a whammy that genuinely took me by surprise (it takes a lot to do this). Kudos to the author. More, please. "}, {"Review": "Daaaamn. I did not see that ending coming! I read a lot of mystery and suspense novels, so I feel like I can spot what's coming fairly easily, but this one took me totally by surprise. I'm not the least bit shocked that this book has already been optioned for a film even before it's release. I almost wish I didn't know what happens so that I could enjoy it all over again.What a fantastic debut by a new author! I can't wait to read his next one (and the one after that)."}], "ID": "40097951", "Name": "The Silent Patient"}
