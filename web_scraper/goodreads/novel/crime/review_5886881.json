Slit me at my belly and it might slide out, meaty and dark, drop on the floor so you could stomp on it.\u201d I highly recommend reading this whilst sitting in the sun with plenty of happy people around you (as I did) - that way you can avoid contracting something evil and nasty from its pages, and also avoid losing any hope you had for humanity.

And I was so hooked by the mystery right away, I just flew through this book. Toward the end I did feel like we lost a little steam, but all the twists and revelations still kept things interesting, and overall I thoroughly enjoyed this!

Sharp Objects was nasty enough, and Dark Places is just as vile. Luckily for her, I (along with millions of people) like vile now and then.Libby Day is a sole survivor of a horrendous massacre. Her mother and two sisters were brutally killed one winter night and, mostly thanks to Libby's testimony, the murders were attributed to Libby's older brother Ben, an alleged active Satan worshiper."}, {"Review": "{BR with Scarlet} \"The truly frightening flaw in humanity is our capacity for cruelty - we all have it.\"  I have no emotions left. This is a book that will stay with me forever. It left me speechless in different ways, with pretty intense emotions from anger and sadness coupled with hopelessness. This is not just a thriller/mystery/suspense novel but an absolute psychological roller coaster. I found myself almost too scared to keep reading, but so riveted I just HAD to find out what would happen"}, {"Review": "Gillian Flynn's first novel, Sharp Objects, was interestingly disturbing; in fact, it walked a razor-thin line between \"Huh, you certainly don't read that every day\" and \"Gillian Flynn has some serrrriiiious issues and I'm a little bit afraid of her\". I wasn't sure whether I respected her extremely dark side or her dark side is so dark it makes her books kind of uncomfortable to read. Strangely enough (once you know the story outline) Dark Places actually has a more conventional plot than Sharp"}, {"Review": "Normally I wouldn't give a genre book like this a 5-star review, because I'm picky and controlling about handing out major praise. How could a crime/mystery be as good as, say, Thomas Hardy or Alice Munro? Apples and oranges.But I just finished this about five minutes ago, and it made me gasp. It's so good -- a well-paced page-turner, beautifully wrought. I literally couldn't put it down for longer than a couple hours at a time once I picked it up (with the exception of sleep).According to her A"}, {"Review": "I have now officially read all of Gillian Flynn's books, and I really enjoyed this one!The story and the characters were so twisted, and the last hour or so of the audiobook was insaaaane.

This is my second novel by Gillian Flynn, and now I am realizing that I have been reading them backwards, I mean in the opposite publishing order, but this has been due mainly the order of film adaptations. However, I won\u2019t wait until having any film adaptation of Sharp Objects, to read that one. I do hope to read it in the following months.My reading experience with Gone Girl wasn\u2019t any good"}, {"Review": "When person or persons unknown murdered her entire family, seven year old Libby Day managed to escape and fingered her brother Ben as the killer.

My soul bonded to this book from the first word. Page turner and an unforgettable ride. A hell of a ride. The movie is just as good and I can rarely say that about books and movies.

Finally a mystery that keeps its appeal intact after the first 50% and does not make me roll my eyes all duh! like in the end. Let's see why, shall we?\u25ba Highly recommended if you can stomach the depression. *whispers* In the end, I even rooted for Libby. Don't ask me why. I just did. Nobody's perfect, okay? I said that the characters made me sick, but oh, the sadness. The despair. The misunderstandings. The loneliness. My heart aches from lack of hope."}, {"Review": "Well. I can't really say that I liked this book. None of the characters are likable, including the main character. Libby Day's family was killed by her brother when she was 7. By the time she hits 30, she's still 7 inside, her inner growth stunted by the tragedy. She can barely take care of herself, has never had a job, and suddenly the money that strangers donated out of charity over the years is down to about $900. To replenish her bank account, Libby grudgingly agrees to pimp herself out to a"}, {"Review": "This book was insaaaaane. But so so good. Dark Places was my first Gillian Flynn book (though I have seen the Gone Girl movie) but I fully plan on picking up her other books now.It\u2019s the kind of novel that makes you question what on earth we humans can come up with. I kept wondering what was going on in Gyllian Flynn\u2019s head. How does she think of these things?Dark Places is vile, macabre and gruesome. The author doesn\u2019t hold back, instead she seemingly bombards you with everything ugly that is o"}, {"Review": "Dark Places is a masterpiece, composed of troubled characters,disturbing deeds and buried secrets.For me, it wasn't as good as Gone Girl or Sharp Objects but it still managed to be a fantastic mystery, full of suspense and tragedy.Gillian Flynn takes a similar route with her characters as Libby Day is a deeply troubled individual, seeking the truth behind her family's murder.She uncovers numerous shocking truths which shape this novel into a true page-turner.Libby Day is an incredibly complex ch"}, {"Review": "I didn\u2019t like  Gone Girl, which I though started quite well but went rapidly down hill from half way.

Draw a picture of my soul and it'd be a scribble with fangs.\" Flynn has a gift for creating absolutely despicable characters that you can't help but sympathize with. Everyone in this book is horrible, from the narrator's ten-year-old sister, who is a gossip-monger and blackmails people for their silence, to the deadbeat dad who physically threatens his wife for money. Even the main character, Libby, isn't spared. She's the"}, {"Review": "\u201cI was not a lovable child, and I'd grown into a deeply unlovable adult.

The most interesting thing about this book in my opinion was Libby's character. Where Gone Girl started out slow and then got really good, this one started out amazing and then went flat.

Ms. Flynn isn't known for writing likable characters to be inspired by, but Libby was interesting.

However, be warned, the content is pretty graphic."}, {"Review": "Gillian Flynn scares the shit out of me. Whilst this is nothing more than pure conjecture, it wouldn\u2019t surprise me to learn she was a serial killer in a former life, or that she stabs bunnies and kittens and hamsters and toy poodles during her spare time (for research purposes). Sure, she has her shit together, but she has an interesting way of sprinkling her love for Kansas across 368 ink-splattered pages.
