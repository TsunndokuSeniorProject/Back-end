{"Genre": "Crime", "Reviews": [{"Review": "*Trigger Warning, book contains very explicit content and violence.*Inspired by one of the busiest seaports on the West Coast in the US, Townsend was a well-documented hot spot for smuggling in the late 1880\u2019s. This makes it a perfect setting for a historical fiction novel with such a daring plot.

Add in a female protagonist and I was all set to like it. Unfortunately, it didn\u2019t engage me the way I hoped. The writing was as dense as pea soup. Alma Rosales goes undercover as a man to find who is stealing opium from her boss, Delphine, who is also her former lover. But I really didn\u2019t take an interest in Alma. I had trouble buying into her ability to pose as a man. S"}, {"Review": "I was pleasantly surprised by Katrina Carrasco's The Best Bad Things which I picked up through NetGalley. I thought the premise behind this story was new and refreshing. Set in America's Gilded Age, The Best Bad Things illustrates how women were treated during that time, the juxtaposition of poverty with the onset of industrialization. Carrasco takes advantage of these happenings highlighting the building of the Railroad system and the opium epidemic within the context of the story. The main cha"}, {"Review": "I was so excited to read this one, but it really ended up being a let down for me! I couldn't finish it. I found the writing really dense and dry and I was just so bored. Apparently fighting and opium smuggling are not my thing. A lot of people clearly had a much better experience, so I'd say give it a try if the blurb sounds interesting, but this one was just not for me.*I received a free copy of this book from NetGalley in exchange for an honest review."}, {"Review": "A vivd cast of characters, a strong decisive style, and a burning tension throughout make The Best Bad Things a book I can highly recommend.

Well written with much mystery and enough intrigue. Hopefully there will be more from this author in a series that promises originality and style."}, {"Review": "3.5 Stars. "}, {"Review": "This was not for me. Alma Rosales was a completely unbelievable character, and I couldn't suspend my disbelief. I wanted to love this book and the description attracted me mostly because of Alma. She isn't like anybody I've read about before and that appealed to me--I'd love to read more with gender fluid characters of color in a different book. But beyond the almost superhuman protagonist (she can fight anybody and miraculously heal!), I wasn't into the writing style or the violence, especially"}, {"Review": "The highest compliment I can pay this book is to say that it completely consumed my brain while I was reading it -- everything that happened in my day made me think of it, and I spent most of my waking moments at least 15% in its world. Everything in that world is distinctive and fully formed, from the environment to the relationships and the characters, and the comfort with which Carrasco addresses the complexities of gender is impressive and reassuring. So, basically: Better than Cats, would r"}, {"Review": "This book sounded like it was tailor-made for me. Female Pinkerton agent in pre-statehood Washington (Port Townsend, to be exact), AND she likes the ladies? I've never wanted Netgalley to approve me for a book than this one. It did not disappoint!While it has a strong mystery plot as the backbone, the real draw of this book is the main character (who is bisexual, as it turns out). Alma is one of the toughest protagonists I've read in a long time. Is Alma good or bad? Is she the law or a criminal"}, {"Review": "3.5 Stars Alma Rosales is a new sort of heroine. She\u2019s smart. She\u2019s brash. She\u2019s a snoop and a spy. She\u2019s daring, sharp-tongued and maybe a little too full of herself. Her self-confidence is both a blessing and a curse as she sets off on high-adrenaline historical fiction suspenseful thrill ride.

It\u2019s unlike anything else, a remarkable and revelatory debut tackling the intersections of gender, violence, lust, greed, and power against the historical backdrop of late 19th century Washington State in the age of mining, shipping, and opium smuggling.

Reading The Best Bad Things is like being plunged into a queer historical action-adventure movie, with the character-driven nuance of prestige TV\u2014and literary fiction.

To be clear, I don't think this is necessarily a BAD book. There is some very solid writing in here. I think it just wasn't a match for me.The book does have a damn fine opening though.

Alma is newly arrived in Port Townsend, and is there on a mission. Part One: figure out who is the head of the opium game in town. Part Two: take his place.

Everything about this book seriously excellent; the writing is raw and compelling, leaving me utterly spellbound from the outset.

Some things are better than the sum of their parts, like the 2016 Super Bowl Champion NE Patriots. This book is the opposite. Everything is in place for a terrific historical suspense thriller \u2013 a compelling protagonist, a richly researched time and place, a dramatic plot with a lot of competing interests, beautifully written sentences and a fine ear for dialog, many good secondary characters.

But the story of the women who chose to dress as men, and swagger their way through the early part of the century defies that explanation. Alma Rosales is a ruthless, ambitious ex-Pinkerton detective. She works as a man named Jack Camp. More than bisexual, Rosales/Camp seems to have no fixed sexual identity at all; she slips into either of her identities with ea"}, {"Review": "Who knew that sleepy Port Townsend could ever have been so exciting? This was compelling reading and I never considered putting it down, but this is a brutal book. There is a lot of sex, a lot of violence, and a lot of mixing of the two. If any of that bothers you, consider this a warning. The ending left a bad taste in my mouth and I'm still struggling with my overall rating for this. Very interesting heroine, but not sure that I would read another. On the other hand, it looks like a next book"}, {"Review": "Queer bisexual mystery of my dreams, where have you been all my life?! I love queer, subversive characters. Gritty mysteries. Well-written sexual tension. Yet I've never gotten all three in one book -- until The Best Bad Things. I found myself constantly delighted by how Carrasco's characters transgress the social norms we (or at least I) usually assume were in place during the late 1800s. As a queer person, it was so incredibly refreshing to read.The book really picked up for me about halfway t"}, {"Review": "108 pages in but I wasn't hooked by the characters or the plot. The story features a woman who goes undercover as Alan to sniff out the snitches in 1870s west coast. I had trouble following all the characters and who was double-crossing whom. After reading a few other reviews that shared the same feelings I had, I decided to put this book to rest, at least for now. "}, {"Review": "I received this book as a Goodreads Giveaway, and I would like to thank the publisher for sending me a copy. Carrasco's historical novel, thickly plotted and populated with disreputable characters, tells a story of violence and backstabbing amid nineteenth-century America's western smugglers. Though rich in historical and sensory detail, the action and characterization of the characters often comes over the top, making for a story not fully engaging. "}, {"Review": "Probably 3.5 stars. Gritty & gripping. (Sometimes too gritty.) I enjoyed the feminist bent to the story, but that piece of it didn't feel fully authentic in a few spots. Could have been trimmed a bit to make the story tighter. The atmosphere tied in well with other books I've read such as By Gaslight and A Moment in the Sun. Overall, a rip-roaring read. "}, {"Review": "A wild, violence-filled ride full of the most colorful characters and a real sense of how wild the wild west used to be.

You know when an author merely tells a story with their writing? In The Best Bad Things, Carrasco's writing is the story. This book is fierce, loud, and unforgettable.
