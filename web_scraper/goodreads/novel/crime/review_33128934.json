{"Genre": "Crime", "Reviews": [{"Review": " In the morning, there's another girl floating dead in the lake. Easily one of the better mystery/thrillers I've read this year. After disappointments from old favourites with Since We Fell and newly-hyped thrillers like Final Girls, I managed to find a really creepy, suspenseful story from an author who has always been a bit hit and miss for me.The book starts with a very dramatic and gruesomely exciting opening chapter. I've grown to appreciate slow build novels, but thrillers that pull out a"}, {"Review": " Gina never asked about the garage. That thought would keep her awake every night for years after, pulsing hot against her eyelids. I should have asked. Should have known. But she'd never asked, she didn't know, and in the end, that was what destroyed her. There were some things that I didn't totally like in the book, but for the most part it was really good! **Mild Spoilers**It's been a few years now and Gina is now Gwen and she is living in Stillhouse Lake, TN <-- I live in TN =) Gwen is li"}, {"Review": "My reviews can also be found at: https://deesradreadsandreviews.wordpr...I\u2019ve been trying to stay away from reading any new series until I finish the ones I\u2019ve already started. However, I\u2019ve been seeing \u201cStillhouse Lake\u201d pop up everywhere lately, and after reading the description and a few reviews, I had to admit, I was intrigued. I decided I had to read it... and I\u2019m really glad I did.Normally, Gina Royal is home at three in the afternoon, but her husband, Mel, has called and asked her to pick"}, {"Review": "This was exciting from beginning to end! I love this spin on the typical serial killer thriller; here, we see the focus on the family the monster left behind. My nerves constantly ramped up as the tension grew; this was compulsive reading at its finest and I'm so glad I was able to snag this with my Kindle Unlimited membership. I was a bit surprised to see so many typos and formatting issues though; I don't read enough finished ebook copies to know if maybe this is normal? Anyway, it wasn't enou"}, {"Review": "This is probably one of the best psychological thrillers I have read in a while. It had me questioning myself at every twist and turn. I was literally on the edge of my seat during the last three-quarters of the book. I could even feel the paranoia of the main character. Totally messed with my mind!!"}, {"Review": "4.5, PSA: if your partner has a \u201csecret room\u201d burn it TO THE GROUND stars!!!

I mean, stay-up-until-2:00-a.m.-to-finish-it great.

It's the same price for Killman Creek, too! Loved. This. Book.Damn. This ends with cliffhanger that I didn't see coming, though I probably should have. I feel like doing a reread, already.

Then even worse, finding out that your husband has been using that garage as a little chop 'em up shop.Complete with dead body. That's what happens to Gina Royal. The bad thing is? She lived with this dude and had two children by him and never knew that he was one of the most prolific serial killers around.

Told after he is discovered, she and her family have had to go into hiding, changing their identities. Dealing with the trolls who want to punish them for her husband\u2019s crimes. And she still struggles with how she never knew. This is so well done. There\u2019s a great level of suspense and tension throughout the book. A real creepiness factor.

The characters were likeable but flawed.It was a shame really as I had high hopes for this series again I am in the minority but so be it I always say how it is at least I am honest in m"}, {"Review": "Psychological thriller.Started with accident, drunk driver destroyed the garage of serial killer Melvin Royal. Did gruesome killings there. Fooled his wife and kids for years, now they are on the run from people that didn't believe the fact they didn't know what he was doing in that garage. Changing names, schools. Wife Gina always prepared to move if they are discovered. This unstable emotional state taking a toll on all of them. Parts gets little boring, but keep reading.

That thought would keep her awake every night for years after. I should have asked. Should have known. But she's never asked, she didn't know, and in the end, that was what destroyed her.  And so the story begins.....I was in the mood for an engrossing thriller and this turned out to be exactly that, making it one of the best thrillers I've read this year! Though she starts off weak Gina/Gwen quickly becomes a likable character. Sh"}, {"Review": "Quick, gripping read with a premise unlike anything else I'd ever read. I grew to love the main character as the book went on, even after being initially put off by her. The younger characters were realistically flawed and likeable. While I did manage to guess a bit of what was really going on, it was a wild and enjoyable ride. I'm definitely going to be watching out for the next in the series, which is released in December.Gwen Proctor underwent a metamorphosis. Once she was Gina Royal, loyal a"}, {"Review": "I finally finished this book. It's been on my currently reading shelf for a month, and I think I read four other books in the time it took me to read this short thriller, but it's finally done. Okay, thoughts-- if it wasn't for the final forty pages I think I would've given this book 2 stars. I can see why this book is popular, and would not sway anyone away from reading it, but there was just so many small things in this story that just kept distracting me as I read it, so many details that I f"}, {"Review": "A fast-paced and intense psychological thriller. Pulls you right in and doesn't let go. Who can be trusted? Is there anywhere that is safe? I loved how strong and fierce Gwen was. She can definitely hold her own. Others are often destroyed by all that she has gone through. Had me thinking about what life is like for those left behind after a crime -- both the perpetrator's and the victim's families. The ending sets you up perfectly for book two in the series. Can't wait to read it!"}, {"Review": "Five extremely intense stars!!!Cannot even imagine being married to a serial killer.... how could you not question your judgment from that point on? How could you ever trust anybody else again? How could you ever feel safe?The author did an absolutely amazing job of putting you in Gina/Gwen\u2018s head for the duration of this book.... I felt just as paranoid and on edge as Gina/Gwen did.... this book was extremely hard to put down, I just needed to know what was going to happen to this family next.."}, {"Review": "3.5 stars.

Well, that\u2019s what happened to Gwen Proctor, formerly known as Gina Royal, the identity she had to give up so she and her two children, Lanny and Connor (also new names) could survive. A freak accident exposed her now ex-husband Mel Royal as a brutal serial killer and the court of public opinion viewed Gwen as an accomplice. She was tried and acquitted in the real court o"}, {"Review": "Exceptional, nonstop suspense from an experienced author (Rachel Caine is a pseudonym). There are so many ways this plot could have been made trite or shallow, and none of them show up. When readers start the story, one disbelieves the protagonist's naivete. Yet for the rest of the book, the protagonist describes her boomerang reactions especially to protect her children, and the horrific online fallout. Along with the reader, she self-examines again and again the question of her guilt exactly o"}, {"Review": "In general, I'm picky about endings. A bad ending can ruin the whole book for me. But a good ending can definitely sell me the next book.However, a blatant cliffhanger attempt to sell me the next book is what we have here, and it left me really not wanting to ever read anything by this author again.But this is something I've seen before, and I just realized I'd seen it with this same publisher.
