Then, it becomes too convoluted to keep its realism. So the story isn\u2019t bad per se.

This novel, a child-abduction case, races along at an amazing speed, full of twists and turns, totally gripping the reader for the suspense ride from beginning to end. I kept flipping the pages as I had to know what had happened. I loved it! \u201cThey left their six-month-old baby (Cora) home alone and went to a party next door.\u201d But with the monitor on"}, {"Review": "Wow . . . what was that ending?! OK, let me back up.There's no denying that this is a compulsive page-turner. At the heart of the story is a frenzied pulse running rampant and it\u2019s addicting. Ending chapters with shocking revelations, casting doubt and making me waver on my belief of who was behind it all, time and time again, was pure magic. I read this book over the course of one day, simply because I couldn\u2019t bear to put it down. I had to know who took baby Cora and WHY.With that being said,"}, {"Review": "My reviews can also be seen at: https://deesradreadsandreviews.wordpr...I still haven't listened to very many audiobooks.

It's a nice change and I can close my eyes (as long as I'm not driving).

Anne and Marco have a dinner party to attend next door when the babysitter cancels at the last moment. Of course, being responsible parents, they have no choice but to cancel dinner. Right? Well...no! They make the unbelievably foolish decision to still attend. Their genius solution? Simply leave their 6 month baby home alone and just take the baby monitor!

I also loved that contrary to most thrillers that save the big reveal for the end, in this book, you find out who kidnapped the baby halfway through the book--so you get to watch everyone scramble and unravel from there on out. I liked it so much that I was mentally composing my 4-star revi"}, {"Review": "Cynthia and Graham invite next door neighbours Anne and Marco to a small dinner party but tell them not to bring their small baby.

I was completely sucked in from the start and then at about the 65 % mark the characters started annoying me and I wasn't thrilled with the ending. Some other people might like this more than I did. I read a lot of psychological thrillers so now very few are 5 Star reads for me.A special shout out to Kirsten Potter the narrator. She was awesome!!! This is very easy to follow on audio.

What a wild and \"crazy\" ride!Sometimes when I read a crime-thriller, I become bored with the pace or exasperated with the clues and detective types, but not so this time. Each character had their own complex personality, and/or presence here, and there is never a dull moment.Without giving anything away, I'll just say, be prepared for a shocking crime and horrendous secrets revealed, some of which, you will find terribly disturbing!I entered this mystery not knowing anything about the plot s"}, {"Review": "One star is for me because I finished it. One more star because the author came up with some good character names. Cora Conti, Cynthia Stillwell, Detective Rasbach I'm looking at you.Well, that's about all the nice nice I can make.I can't get past the clunky, amateurish writing!

Imagine also the myriad of emotions you'd experience. Well, that would be bad enough, but what multiplies that horror"}, {"Review": "First of all, I'm a skeptic by nature. By going into a thriller, I go in grudgingly knowing I'm going to be critical. Suspending belief shouldn't be required for a story done well. As I'm reading, this is the constant chatter going on in my head recalling Elaine in a Seinfeld episode - \"maybe the dingo ate your baby.\" I'm thinking anything is possible at this point - including the dang Dingo!This is warped. Let me preface it. A baby is missing.

At all. Yes, very, very edge of your seat worthy reading, but the end result was a little flat for me. As a debut, this was brilliant work and I commend the author for writing a book that most of us just could not put down.I felt it was a train wreck of completely messy, unscrupulous and totally moral lacking characters! I know we are not meant to always love the characters we read about, but I was eye rolling many times. Marco. What a spinel"}, {"Review": " \"They held onto each other, weeping.

As expected I thoroughly enjoyed it, I raced through the intriguing pages and I have to say that it is neck and neck as to which I preferred the best, as both were hugely entertaining.It does takes a while to get used to the authors writing since she uses 'third person present tense' but once you adapt to it you soon fly through the story, it was very eas"}, {"Review": "Anne and Marco's babysitter cancels at the last minute when they have a dinner party next door.

A hypnotic and atmospheric thriller.This story starts off with a familiar- ripped from the headlines- setup where a couple, Ann and Marco, decide to leave their young daughter home alone while they attend a dinner party next door. They bring the baby monitor and check on the baby every half hour. However, when they return home from the party they discover the child has been kidnapped.

Anne and Marco Conti must really have an intense thing for dinner parties. Marco talks Anne into leaving their newborn infant next door with a faulty baby monitor. They will take turns checking on her every 30 minutes. Sounds like a great plan, huh?Our model parents have also taken to tipping back on the wine goblets, too.

They are deprived of outgoing social activities, and when the neighborly couple are inviting the Conti couple to a party, it's hard to resist.There are some twists involved in the plotting of this book one or two of which are ponderous.
