{"Name": "Scarecrow (Danny Sanchez, #1)", "Image": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1381762392l/18669528.jpg", "Reviews": [{"Review": "First and foremost, a large thank you to Matthew Pritchard and Sapere Books for providing me with a copy of this publication, which allows me to provide you with an unbiased review.When the publisher asked me to read this piece, I was taken in by the description provided on the dust jacket. Anything with a serial killer element is sure to bring chills up the spine and keep the reader connected throughout the journey. Danny Sanchez is a reporter for a small newspaper in a British retirement community in Spain. While covering an article about homes being torn down, Sanchez is shocked to discover that there is a body in the wall of one such residence. What makes it even more gruesome is that the body has been emasculated and obviously left for a period of time. After another body is found in a similar state, Sanchez notices the additional clue of face paint on the victim, which triggers something in his memory. Fifteen years before, Sanchez was working in the U.K., where a serial killer was stalking his victims and leaving them with face paint, as well as slashed genitalia. Sanchez returns to the U.K., where he knows the killer has been institutionalized. Might there have been a copycat killer, or could The Scarecrow have had an accomplice during the slayings? The closer Sanchez gets to answers, the more people distance themselves from him. Danny Sanchez refuses to stop until he gets to the bottom of this, even if it means uncovering a network of serial killers working in concert. The trouble is, without knowing how many there are, will impossible to tell just how to stop the body count from growing. Readers can expect some decent writing in this piece, though I am not entirely sure I found the chilling depictions I sought. After reading this piece, I\u2019ve come to discover that the premise for this novel was strong, its writing well-developed, but the delivery lacked a little something. Writing in this genre needs something edgy and sharp, though Pritchard has given readers some work with rounded edges. The gore and the mystery were well-paced, but I needed something that would keep me up well into the night and create worry about the bumps in the night. Danny Sanchez is an interesting character the reader can enjoy in their own way. His gritty journalism background is apparent throughout, as is his determination to get to the bottom of each lead he uncovers. While he appears to be hot on the trail of this mysterious killer, Sanchez cannot crack things wide open or place himself in a position that keeps the reader chilled and guessing. Others in the story offer place sittings to keep the story moving, though I am not entirely enthralled with many of those who grace the various chapters of the story. I will admit that Pritchard had a decent story idea and some great threads on which to build a darker and more ominous story, though it missed the mark. The hunt may have been on, but it was as though everything was discovered in light and sunny weather. I hoped for chills and can only hope that Pritchard\u2019s debut novel was jitters and that he has a lot more in him for the next novel in this series. I\u2019ll give that one a try and hope for the best, as everyone with potential deserves a second chance. Kudos, Mr. Pritchard, for the attempt, but I really hope there\u2019s more to come. Delivery is essential in the genre and I am eager to see if you have it in you. Like/hate the review?

The plot has many different facets to it - a sick and twisted serial killer, amazing character development and taut, fast-moving prose. Add to that a large dollop of intrigue and you've got all the ingredients for a compelling and unputdownable read. I loved how intelligent the killer was, he was smart enough to keep in the favour of some useful people, keeping them sweet until the time he may need them to come to his aid. Not only does this callous and brutal perpetrator murder his victims, but he also has an insatiable appetite for torture, making the investigators even more hell-bent on catching him quickly and perhaps saving the life of his next target in the process.There is a unique and distinctive European flavour the like of which I have rarely come across in the genre before. The Spanish culture seemed to be depicted authentically, presumably due to the time the author spent living there and absorbing the Spanish influences. He also does a fantastic job in illustrating the hardship journalists go through and in depicting the criminal elements that are at play in Almeria. Pritchard's building of our main protagonist, Danny, is wonderful as he manages to make him hard-nosed but very human too. He is also adept at weaving an intricate, thought-provoking novel whilst maintaining an easily readable style that begs to be devoured in a single, frantic page-turning sitting. If you enjoy grisly and disturbing crime fiction that is complex and expertly crafted then this is well worth your time. I will be picking up the next instalment and hope they'll be as impressive and explosive as Scarecrow was. I don't hand out five-star ratings lightly, but Scarecrow is fully deserving of that rating and each star has been thoroughly earned. Miss it, miss out!Many thanks to Sapere Books for an ARC."}, {"Review": "4.5Danny Sanchez, a perceptive and sharp journalist is covering the story of a house which is in the process of being demolished. But when a body is found buried inside one of the walls, the simple task of writing a report turns to an investigation, which would take him back to decades earlier, to another country and to the realm of a cold-hearted and twisted serial killer.Scarecrow, the first book in the series, is a well-written, fast paced and gruesomely engaging book. With smartly put twists here and there and a shocking and satisfying conclusion, it draws you in and doesn\u2019t let you go.Thanks to Matthew Pritchard, Sapere Books and the NetGalley for providing me with an advanced copy."}, {"Review": "I would like to thank Netgalley and Sapere Books for an advance copy of Scarecrow, the first thriller to feature Almer\u00eda based journalist Danny Sanchez.When a house demolition uncovers a mutilated corpse it reminds Danny of the first big case he covered as a journalist in 1995 when \u201cScarecrow\u201d murdered five Englishmen in a horrific manner before being caught and incarcerated in a high security hospital where he still remains. Danny is the only one seeing the link as, for various reasons, neither the British or Spanish Authorities want to know so it\u2019s up to him to investigate.I thoroughly enjoyed Scarecrow which is a fast paced thriller with plenty of twists and turns. It should be noted that the subject matter makes for some gruesome descriptions so it is not for the faint hearted but if you don\u2019t mind it\u2019s a great read which held my attention from start to finish. It is told in the third person, mostly from Danny\u2019s point of view, with the odd chapter outlining the unnamed killer\u2019s thoughts, basically he wants what he wants. This works well as the killer\u2019s identity is well camouflaged and will come as a surprise to many readers. The novel itself is fairly frantic with reveals and developments in every chapter - never a dull moment, exactly what you want from a thriller.I love the depiction of life in Southern Spain as Mr Pritchard looks beyond the tourist image to reveal some of the underlying problems in the region. It\u2019s informative without preaching and provides food for thought. Danny Sanchez is a great creation. He\u2019s not perfect, struggling with personal relationships (inept springs to mind) and single minded in his pursuit of the story, but his interactions with others make him likeable and appear very human.Scarecrow is a good read which I have no hesitation in recommending."}, {"Review": "This novel is not for the faint hearted, I repeat definitely, not for the faint hearted! The novel is of the crime genre but it is extremely dark & edgy. It reminded me in a way of The Poet by Michael Connelly but the author gives it his own unique stamp!The novel opens & we are instantly transported to Almeria Spain; investigative journalist Danny Sanchez is covering the unjust demolition of an elderly retired ex-pat couple\u2019s villa. I liked that the author had featured something we do hear about occurring to ex-pat\u2019s living abroad and found this added authenticity to the story. Danny is well known in the ex-pat community & we learn how such a community exists and operates in Spain. When the dust settles from the demolition a body is discovered amongst the rubbles and not just any body this one is wearing a gimp mask! The body is clearly that of a murder victim. But how did it get there? Why has someone been murdered in such a way? When the builder of the property is attacked with a hammer, Danny & his photographer Paco decide to dig a little deeper.The builder Hacker & his 3 sons are by no means nice people. They are nasty, violent bullies whom have been terrorising the people of Spain for some time. They\u2019re ex-pat\u2019s themselves but with Rottweilers named Yorkshire & Ripper have done nothing to improve the image of the British. Danny & Paco discover that Alan Reade\u2019s (Hacker\u2019s plumber) villa is also rumoured to have a perfuse scent of death. Cue a little unethical detective work & another body is discovered. The body is covered in perverse clown make-up and appears to have experienced torture/humiliation prior to death. Who is sealing murder victims into walls? Is this the work of a serial killer? Why are the victims being tortured & humiliated in this way? Who is stalking the local community?This reminds Danny of a previous case he has worked in England & quickly we are brought up to speed on the \u2018Scarecrow killer\u2019. Ishmael Vertaness is incarcerated in a high secure psychiatric facility in the UK after his spate of 5 murders. The Scarecrow humiliated, tortured, raped and emasculated his victims. He is rumoured to be on the autism spectrum but due to his failing mental health and abusive childhood, no-one can know with absolute certainty what made him do it. Four of the Scarecrow\u2019s victims were known to be heterosexual men and not linked to the gay community. The Spanish authorities refuse to link the recent victims or have any belief in a link to a UK case. They do this in part to protect the image of Spain & prevent widespread possible international hysteria in relation to the crimes. Danny continues to gather information & evidence. This novel is heavily layered and thoroughly gripping reading! Danny decides that in order to gather more information he must return to the UK and work with old contacts. Did the Scarecrow have an accomplice? Will he agree to see Danny? Is he really autistic & how did this impact his criminal behaviour? With Danny\u2019s return to the Uk we learn a more in-depth scope of the Scarecrow murders & the cross border murders. We learn more about the victim and hear the surviving family\u2019s story\u2019s. As stated before this novel covers the crimes of a violent, dominant & sadist serial killer. It covers a wide-range of issues from cocaine use to rent boys & even gay men who experience self-hatred. How do wealthy boys go from privilege to charging 20 euros a trick? What makes men vulnerable to rape?But what it also covers without really trying to, is the real life modern day media reporting of covering stories with a possibly theme of gay sex or male rape. In the UK in August 2016 a man named Nigel Wilkinson was arrested & sentenced. Nigel was a serial rapist, whom posed as a male fitness photographer to allow him the trust & access to drug and rape many male victims. What is also frightening about Nigel is he was known to specifically target straight men. Even stating he liked to \u2018take their masculinity\u2019. Nigel was able to get away with his crimes for so long, that when finally caught he had amassed far too many victims. I think this novel highlights an area where the media fail & I applaud the author for covering such a crime, despite its dark nature. The issues/themes are covered with sensitivity.The case builds and builds, with the Scarecrow & one of Hacker\u2019s sons making threats, Paco\u2019s daughter being kidnapped. Danny needs to uncover the killer & fast! The novel has a huge twist, that even I didn\u2019t spot coming! It is one that will shock most readers & also reveals a dark theme not explored earlier. I read this in 24hrs & can\u2019t praise it enough. If you seek a crime novel that breaks the mould, then this is the one for you! Scarecrow is available free for members of Kindle unlimited or available for the bargain price of \u00a32.99 on Kindle E-book. It will scare you\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..You have been warned! 5/5* "}, {"Review": "I would like to thank Sapere books and the Author for a free copy of this book in exchange of an honest review.4,5 Stars rounded to 5 Stars.This book was a very agreeable surprise after hitting a rather long slump with thrillers lately. Danny Sanchez, a journalist half british half Spanisch and working in the fascinating Almeria Province in southern Spain, was supposed to simply cover the story of a house being demolished. There was a surprise waiting for them however, a body trapped between two walls of the bathroom. Only, that was not the sole problem. Danny Sanchez, has already seen bodies mutilated that way and it was in a closed case, almost a decade old, with the serial killer caught and locked safely behind the walls of a prison.What begin with a mysterious dead body, turned into an incredible investigation following the trail of a rather devious and innovatively creepy serial killer. I enjoyed the whole story, the way it was written and the various characters, how some events that didn't seem really pertinent turned out to be the leads to key informations and opening a whole new aspect to the investigation.The setting was what made me want to read this book in the first place and i loved that contrast between South of Spain and the UK, in the way people lived and behaved.All along, I created many scenarios in my head while reading, trying to figure out what was happening and how. I did manage to narrow down my suspicion to the right \"sphere\" but i definitely did not see that end coming. One other thing i liked about this book isn't exactly related to the serial killer, rather to the life in general in south Spain. I had no idea the situation with expats and immigrants was that complicated. I like it when i learn something new from a thriller (other than new twisted methods of new serial killers).It was a very enjoyable book, i highly recommend it and i would definitely look for the other books of the Danny Sanchez series."}, {"Review": "I would like to thank NetGalley and Endeavour Press for giving me the opportunity to read this which I voluntarily reviewed.This is the first book I've read by Mr Pritchard but I'll definitely be reading more.I was drawn to this book primarily because of the locations, Spain and England.As I live in Spain I could relate to the problems their beaurocracy causes.This is a very dark and graphic novel and is not for the faint hearted.The characters, both good and bad, are all well drawn and believable.This is a fast paced novel which draws you in from page one.I hope this is the start of a long series about Danny Sanchez, investigative journalist."}, {"Review": "Scarecrow by Matthew PritchardPublished by Salt Publishing.\u201cWhen Danny Sanchez, a hard-bitten journalist working in the Almeria region of Spain is sent to cover the demolition of the home of a retired expat couple, he lands a much bigger \u2013 and more grisly \u2013 story than he bargained for. As the diggers begin to tear down the house, a body, partially decomposed, its face swathed in a strange black sheath, is suddenly revealed dangling in the depths of the brickwork\u2026\u201dThere\u2019s been an asesinato. In fact there\u2019s been another and another . . . all found mutilated and entombed within the walls of Spanish villas around Almeria. As the bodies pile up, the mystery deepens, and with that comes an increasing sense of danger for journalist Danny Sanchez. What first impressed me about Scarecrow are the lengths Pritchard goes to when immersing the reader in life beneath the Spanish sun. Write what you know is clearly on show here as we get a true sense of the frustrated journalist, how the British react to life abroad and the quarrels between those wishing simply to settle and make home and the convoluted twists of the Spanish governmental system. Pritchard paints the scene so vividly, the true joy of this book isn\u2019t the murder mystery element, but the setting and the life surrounding it. Spain should be a place of sun, sea, sex and sangria, but Pritchard lifts up and exposes the grim underbelly of life in Almeria. From the criminal element that thrive and deceive in the climate, the wandering unfortunates that immigrate illegally with a want for a better life and the inept, often corrupt governments that will just as happily take money from ex-pats and then crush their dreams with as much glee. This melting pot provides us with a dangerous though beautiful setting.The story holds well and the character of the intrepid reporter Danny Sanchez is likable, earnest and with enough flaws to warrant the reader to root for him throughout. His quest for the truth is admirable as it stretches beyond simply wanting to know the grim details of the murders, but the why, and then who, as it becomes apparent that the killer is still at work. The supporting cast of characters gives us enough suspects to keep us guessing until the final few pages as to who the killer might be. They are close, but how close?All in all, an immersive and easy to read whodunit than manages to be smart without isolating the reader, and with a plot that that draws the reader in without being too simplistic. I wouldn\u2019t recommend reading it on holiday though.5/5"}, {"Review": "\u2018How could that be? Fifteen years later and here was another body, exactly the same.\u2019Danny Sanchez, a journalist working in Spain, is covering the judicial demolition of a villa belonging to Arthur and Peggy Cooke, an ex-patriate British couple in the Almer\u00eda province of Spain. It\u2019s a sad event for the Cookes. They were one of eleven families whose homes are to be demolished for construction irregularities. Danny has been covering the story for some time: construction irregularities are a huge issue in Spain. The demolition begins but is quickly stopped when a dead body is found hidden within the walls of the house.From there events move quickly. Danny is reminded of a case he covered in the UK some years earlier: can it be a copycat murder, or has the UK murderer relocated to Spain? There are a few different strands to this story. There are dodgy builders and missing people as well as some political twists. Along the way we learn something of Danny\u2019s personal life. While I worked out some of the answers before the end of the book, the story kept me interested. I understand that this is the first book in a series to feature Danny Sanchez. I look forward to the next.Note: My thanks to NetGalley and Sapere Books for providing me with a free electronic copy of this book for review purposes.Jennifer Cameron-Smith"}, {"Review": "WOW WOW WOW!!!!This is a new author for me and OMG what a read.Danny Sanchez is a journalist and while in England he covered the Scarecrow killings a set of grisly murders where young men are tortured, castrated and their faces made up using gaudy makeup. The killer was caught and now resides in Deepmere a psychiatric hospital. Danny leaves England for pastures new and moves to Spain. He is covering a humanitarian story of an English couple who are having their home demolished due to not having the right planning permission. While the bulldozer is pulling their home apart a grisly sight is revealed, a body has been lodged in one of the the inner walls. Danny sees the body and is shocked. He has seen a body like this before but the killer was caught.I DEVOURED this book in one sitting. It got my heart racing and i spent most of my time sitting on the edge of my seat. This is a rollercoaster of a crime thriller and i had no idea who the killer was until they were revealed. This is crime thriller that is graphic, full of suspense, tension and is very atmospheric. I can't wait to see what this author does next. A must read and Highly Recommended. I would like to thank Sepere Books for the ARC of this book in return for giving an honest review. "}, {"Review": "After reading Matthew Pritchard's Stolen Lives (a suspenseful mystery based on Spain's baby trafficking scandal), I found Kindle Unlimited offered Pritchard's Scarecrow, the first in the Danny Sanchez novels. It turned out to be a serial killer plot that was gruesome, but suspenseful. Set in Spain and London, journalist Danny Sanchez deals with problems with his newspaper, his mother, and a breaking story concerning a body encased in the walls of a house in the process of being demolished.In this first book in the series, Danny attends the demolition of a house owned by British ex-pats that he had interviewed when they first received notice that their home was to be torn down. The elderly couple is devastated by the prospect of losing their life savings due to legal tangles. When the body is discovered in the walls, Danny is reminded of case he covered in England during the early part of his career. But the scarecrow killer was convicted and resides in a psychiatric facility in England. Is this a copy-cat killing? More sinister elements are revealed as Danny follows the thread in England. He is supposed to be taking time off, but can't curtail his curiosity about the similarities, and on returning to Spain, Danny finds himself and those he cares about in danger. More bodies are discovered, and the killer has an eye on Danny.Crime/Suspense. 2012. Print length: 320 pages."}, {"Review": "Scarecrow is the debut novel by Matthew Pritchard, credit where credit is due, you would never know that this is his first, a crime thriller, with a really heavy leaning on the thriller part, Scarecrow is absolutely gripping from the off through to the end, Pritchard confidently does not bother to waste time describing things down to the finest point of minute details which is my usual gripe with this kind of novel, instead using a couple of sentences to set the scene using very well written characters and brilliant, and often harsh dialogue, to deliver the plot. I can\u2019t really find any point to pick up on which slows the pace or detracts from the novel at all. The balance between the lead character a journalist, Danny Sanchez and the villan is very well done and the little antagonist parts in-between really play their parts down to perfection. "}, {"Review": "A page turner! First in a new gripping thriller series: A crime thriller from a different perspective: that of a journalist. Danny Sanchez is a young reporter with a Spanish Newspaper. He\u2019s bilingual: English and Spanish having been brought up in England.A mutilated body is discovered hidden in the structure of a new house. Danny covers the story and it isn\u2019t long before Danny manages to lead the Spanish police to uncover another body similarly mutilated and hidden. Although the Spanish Police deny there are any links between the two murders, Danny thinks otherwise. He is sure a serial killer is on the loose. Danny recalls the victims of an English serial killer which he covered in England in his very early reporting days and has a hunch the crimes are connected. This leads him back to England to research the possibility that a serial killer is still on the loose and now based in Spain. Is Danny correct and was the man locked up for the 1990's Scarecrow murders operating with an accomplice? Will he manage to convince the police of the connection between the crimes?The tension is heightened when Danny receives a death threat from the very man he is chasing. Danny\u2019s family is in danger. Danny must identify the killer before the killer ends Danny\u2019s chase.A gripping and truly thrilling novel, boasting an original plot and twists and turns making this an excellent and enjoyable thriller.

Danny Sanchez, a reporter for a local ex-pat newspaper, is attending the demolition of the home owned by an English couple when a dead body is found hidden within the walls of the house. Chillingly, something about the body reminds Danny of a case he covered in the UK several years ago. He is determined to investigate \u2013 is it a \u2018copycat\u2019 murder or worse, is it linked to the old case and has the killer moved to Spain? The action moves along at a good pace, although it\u2019s not until the last third of the book that it really flows. The author\u2019s knowledge of Spain, both geographical and political, and especially journalism, shine through strongly, giving a very authentic feel to the setting, the action and the motives behind some of the characters. Teasers, which explain some of the background, are neatly dropped into the story without feeling contrived. The characters are well drawn, warts and all, and feel real. Not quite a five star read as it sometimes gives the impression of being a travel advertisement for Spain, rather than a novel and at times the story feels constructed, rather than written, so that it then doesn\u2019t flow easily and draw the reader in as well as it could. However, I did enjoy the book and would definitely read more by this author as I want to see what happens to the characters next.Thanks to Sapere Books for a free copy of the book in exchange for an honest review."}, {"Review": "Intriguing, suspenseful and insightful, Scarecrow is an unpredictable thriller that held my attention and didn\u2019t let go. The funny thing is that I lived in Andalusia for decades and Matthew Pritchard really seems to get its culture, traditions and quirks. He applies his keen journalist eye and exposes some of the most unsettling aspects of life in Southern Spain. But the best part is the actual murder mystery, which spans decades over two countries and involves tons of suspects. Journalist Danny Sanchez is covering a gruesome murder in Spain that reminds him of old cases back in England. The only problem is that the culprit was found and arrested. This could be a copycat, but the baddie seems to know details that were never made public. The plot is excellently weaved and smaller, apparently inconsequential incidents completely turn everything on its head and have unexpected results. I didn\u2019t see the ending coming and I had no idea who the killer was. I\u2019m curious to see where Danny goes next. I received a free copy from the Publisher, but I chose to read this book and all opinions in this review are my own and completely unbiased. Thank you, Sapere Books!

Danny Sanchez moved to Spain several years ago but when a body is discovered buried in the walls of a house, he starts to suspect the murder is linked to a case he worked on in the UK. The \u2018scarecrow\u2019 was imprisoned in the UK and the Police were certain he was the killer but Danny has his doubts. He works closely with other journalists in Spain and the UK and together they piece it all together. I really enjoyed this book, especially the second half, as the pace picked up and I enjoyed trying to work out who was behind the murders. The police do have a role to play so don\u2019t think it\u2019s a gung ho journalist saving the day. The story cleverly weaves many characters involvement in the investigation together.

As a reporter for a local paper in Almeria his presence isn\u2019t welcomed by either the local or the UK police. Consequently he has to resort to subterfuge in order to carry out an investigation nobody in authority appears to want to pursue.The author obviously knows the Spanish setting, and especially the British \u2018expat\u2019 community, well.

I'm very glad I went for it as I think I've found a new author. The author's real life experience makes the Danny Sanchez character all the more interesting. I particularly liked the added detail of Sanchez being bilingual and showing us Spain through the eyes of both the Spanish and the ex-pats. It kept me engaged throughout and I enjoyed the uncovering of the killer. I definitely recommend this to crime fans and will be reading future Danny Sanchez books."}, {"Review": "Not my genre, but I really enjoyed the novel despite the rather awful subject matter. All through the book the situations Danny found himself in we\u2019re just ordinary situations that basically did not require violence and shooting together out of. He used reason.Danny\u2019s trip to Britain seemed to signal a change in writing style from sunny Spain to gloomy England, despite the fact that the mystery was starting to be solved.Danny was an ordinary bloke who had confront a horrifically disturbing problem. A 5* book all the way!"}, {"Review": "**Four and 1/2 stars!!In a word: A nail-biting murder mystery with a distinct European flavor, steady pacing that leads to an exciting finish, and characters with depth and humor.It was a long time since Danny had been in a house like this: the sofa with its neatly arranged cushions, lace doilies set out on the coffee table, a valance above the window made to match the fabric of the curtains. Leather-bound volumes of Reader\u2019s Digest were arranged in the bookcases that lined the walls. A carriage clock stood on the mantelpiece above a crotched fireguard. The clock ticked conspicuously in the way that Danny had noticed clocks always seemed to do in unhappy houses; it was something to do with being surrounded by silence, he supposed.You may not have heard of Matthew Pritchard before (I certainly hadn\u2019t before I read his book), but I\u2019m hoping that will change soon. Pritchard is British, and Salt Publishing is a small British publisher that I\u2019ve never heard of, either. But if Scarecrow is any indication of the quality of work they put out, I am very interested in reading more of their books. Scarecrow is a wonderfully professional book for a small publisher, perfectly edited and brilliantly written. Pritchard is a hell of a writer, and he really needs to write more books. Not only that, but someone needs to sell those books here in the United States, for crying out loud! I guess what I\u2019m trying to say is that I was pleasantly surprised by this book, and I hope you take a chance and read it.Danny Sanchez is an expat British journalist living in Spain. One day he is sent to report on a house that is about to be demolished, because of Spain\u2019s tangled legal system. The owners of the house, an older couple who are also expats and have poured every dime they have into their house, are distraught to discover that there is nothing they can do to halt the demolition. But something even worse is about to be revealed, as the demolition crew uncovers a dead body that has been sealed up in the walls of the house. The body has garish make-up smeared over its face and its genitals have been mutilated, and before you can say \u201csex crime,\u201d another body in a similar state turns up in another house\u2019s walls.Danny thinks there might be a connection to a string of murders from a case years ago, but how could there be, since the killer, nicknamed \u201cScarecrow,\u201d was caught and is still behind bars? But Danny is convinced and won\u2019t let anything stop him from uncovering the truth, including Spanish bureaucrats who are trying to keep the distasteful details of the murders a secret and an editor with his own agenda. Dealing with an intelligent killer has its risks, as Danny is about to find out, and it\u2019s only with the help of some trusted friends and some quick thinking that Danny will be able to figure out this case before the killer strikes again.I loved that the protagonist in this story is a reporter, rather than a cop or a private detective. It made for a very refreshing serial killer story. There\u2019s more to Danny than meets the eye. He\u2019s dealing with his out-of-control mother who has come to stay with him; he\u2019s just met a girl he likes but is having the worst time connecting with her; and as tenacious a reporter as he is, he can\u2019t get anyone to back up his theory about who the serial killer might be. I loved the humor that infused the story whenever Danny was dealing with his mother or trying to schedule a date with Marsha!I also enjoyed the back story about Danny\u2019s reporter friend Ray, a man whose death Danny feels responsible for (but isn\u2019t). Danny struggles with his feelings for Ray when he\u2019s forced to deal with Ray\u2019s wife during the investigation, which only made him more human and likeable.The story was well-paced, and Pritchard doles out clues slowly and carefully throughout the book, until the end when the action and danger intensify. Danny\u2019s story is interspersed with short chapters from the killer\u2019s point of view, which really added to the creep factor. We see glimpses into the killer\u2019s mindset, but the author is careful not to give anything away. Danny\u2019s job is to connect all the dots, and with his journalist\u2019s instincts, he manages to figure everything out, even when everyone seems to get in his way.The only issue I had with Scarecrow were the frequent British words peppered throughout the book, many of them legal terms. As I am unabashedly American, I\u2019m not embarrassed to admit that I stumbled over things like \u201ccoroner\u2019s inquest,\u201d \u201copen verdict,\u201d and \u201cenquiry.\u201d On the other hand, the British-expat-living-in-Spain scenario gave the story an exotic feel that I really enjoyed, especially for a small-town California gal like me!If you are looking for a complex and slow building mystery, with humor as well as the necessary ick factor that comes with stories about serial killers, Scarecrow is just the thing. I\u2019m hoping that enough attention from American readers will compel some publishing company on this side of the pond to take notice of Matthew Pritchard. The attention would be well deserved.Many thanks to the publisher for supplying a review copy."}], "Genre": "Crime", "ID": "18669528", "Desc": ""}
