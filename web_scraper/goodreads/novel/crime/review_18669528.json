The plot has many different facets to it - a sick and twisted serial killer, amazing character development and taut, fast-moving prose. Add to that a large dollop of intrigue and you've got all the ingredients for a compelling and unputdownable read. I loved how intelligent the killer was, he was smart enough to keep in the favour of some"}, {"Review": "4.5Danny Sanchez, a perceptive and sharp journalist is covering the story of a house which is in the process of being demolished. But when a body is found buried inside one of the walls, the simple task of writing a report turns to an investigation, which would take him back to decades earlier, to another country and to the realm of a cold-hearted and twisted serial killer.Scarecrow, the first book in the series, is a well-written, fast paced and gruesomely engaging book. With smartly put twists"}, {"Review": "I would like to thank Netgalley and Sapere Books for an advance copy of Scarecrow, the first thriller to feature Almer\u00eda based journalist Danny Sanchez.When a house demolition uncovers a mutilated corpse it reminds Danny of the first big case he covered as a journalist in 1995 when \u201cScarecrow\u201d murdered five Englishmen in a horrific manner before being caught and incarcerated in a high security hospital where he still remains.

The funny thing is that I lived in Andalusia for decades and Matthew Pritchard really seems to get its culture, traditions and quirks.

As a reporter for a local paper in Almeria his presence isn\u2019t welcomed by either the local or the UK police.

I'm very glad I went for it as I think I've found a new author. The author's real life experience makes the Danny Sanchez character all the more interesting. I particularly liked the added detail of Sanchez being bilingual and showing us Spain through the eyes of both the Spanish and the ex-pats.
