And maybe I'll pick it up again some day, but as of right now, I'm having a hard time stomaching it for its... politics.It's a true reflection of Rowling's staunchly center-left politics, as she takes sharp digs at far leftists as well as the conservatives. That's fine.

I think it is the best so far although some parts could have been trimmed by the editor. It starts to resemble the Harry Potter series, with each book longer and longer. If this one has 650 pages I hope the next will not have 800 or more.

That being said, JKR puts together a damn good mystery and I loved all of the actual mystery parts of this story. She is the *best* at creating great and interesting and fun characters.

Rowling who is the ghostly figure here. I don't fear being ostracized for my rating. But most of my friends have given this book higher ratings than me.The denouement was not the balm that could assuage the page upon page of nothingness. The murderer's identity was moot.

I love Strike\u2019s relationship with his now parter, Robin Ellacott. The two work so well together. I started the series with an audiobook and have continued to do so. The narrator\u2019s voice is striking and perfect for Cormoran\u2019s tough guy persona. Strike likes intelligent women and treats them as his equal. Always a wonderful thing to come upon in a book. There is nothing like seeing a woman with a good mind given the"}, {"Review": "This should have been a magnificent book, but in the end I am giving it four stars and saying it was very good indeed. The one star deduction is for the way the book began. At first it was just so slow - not a lot happened and Robin's endless monologues about whether she loved him or not ( and there are two possible hims there) went on and on. And on.Then we started to get into the meat of the story and crimes were committed, people went undercover, some characters acted really badly, some had t"}, {"Review": "Liked and disliked it in equal measure. I am tired of Robin and Matthew as a dysfunctional couple. At book four it feels like the author is milking a dead horse. A white horse, the book is infested with them.

If you have read those you know exactly what to expect here.Lots of characters: Galbraith (Rowling) likes to fill her mysteries with characters.

The mysteries, involving blackmail and a possibly strangled child, are not very compelling until the last quarter of the book. There's an info dump in the last two chapters that sums everything up. However, my major problem is that the book is mostly filler, not mystery. That might be ok if I were really invested in the Strike/Robin relationship (or non-relationship), but I'm not.
