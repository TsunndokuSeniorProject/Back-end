The cold-blooded murders in Kansas in 1956 is described by a cold, distant narrator via the interviews of the family, acquaintances, and community around the victims and the the hair-raising stories of Perry and Bobby, the murderers. It is a real page-turner - I couldn't put it down! The descriptions of the youth of all the tragic p"}, {"Review": "In Cold Blood is the new school classics selection in the group catching up on classics for November 2016. Having read Truman Capote's Breakfast at Tiffany's recently and enjoying his writing, I could not wait to read this nonfiction thriller in advance of the upcoming group read. Writing in his relaxing southern style, Capote turns a horrid crime into a story to make the how's and whys accessible to the average American. It is in this regard that I rate this thrilling classic five stars. On Nov"}, {"Review": "At the beginning, In Cold Blood reads like a classic southern gothic tale. I've read about Harper Lee hanging out with Capote while he put this thing together, and at times it feels like she greatly influenced how it was written. You meet the Clutters who are just the nicest people in the world out working hard and going to school and being awesome people in the town. And, I know there's all this controversy over how the book is written since it adds fictional conversations and thoughts that Cap"}, {"Review": "After I read it, I looked up pictures of the Clutter family, and just stared for about five minutes. They endured what is probably everyone\u2019s worst fear.Having never heard anything of the Clutter murders prior to reading this book, the experience of reading it was intense, gripping, and suspenseful from beginning to end. Capote, with his impartial writing style, relayed facts and details in such a way as to give a complete character illustration of everyone involved: from each of the Clutters, t"}, {"Review": "In Cold Blood by Truman Capote was described by its author as a non-fiction novel. The novel was first published in 1965 and at the time this style of writing, perhaps even the template for a new genre, was fresh and new and bold. Almost 50 years later and the disturbing images are as fresh, vibrant and malevolent as when the ink was wet. The style of writing has no doubt inspired generations of writers since, but their imitation has done little to diminish the power of Capote\u2019s work. Whether it"}, {"Review": "This book is one of the first, if not the first, true crime novel. According to Wikipedia, only Helter Skelter: The True Story of the Manson Murders has sold more copies in the True Crime category than In Cold Blood. While true crime fans might read this today and think that it sounds like your basic true crime story, at the time it was groundbreaking to detail a crime in this much detail and in a format as big as a novel.One of the things it appears that this novel set the precedence for, and t"}, {"Review": "This is one of the great ones. Capote blankets Holcomb, Kansas with his curiosity. The root of this work is a ghastly crime. Two recently released convicts, seeking a fortune that did not exist, invade the Clutter family home, tie up the four family members present and leave no witnesses. It takes some time for the perpetrators to be identified, then tracked down. Capote looks at how the townspeople react to this. Many, fearful that one of their own was responsible, become withdrawn. How do peop"}, {"Review": "A seminal work for the non-fiction novel and the true crime genre, Truman Capote's In Cold Blood stands apart from most of its literary descendants. Not only is it compelling and suspenseful even when you know (like many crime dramatizations) what's going to happen, it's also very well-written. In fact, its literary quality gives In Cold Blood a dimension which few other non-fiction novels will match. The evolution of the form, since In Cold Blood, is nothing short of astonishing. It makes you a"}, {"Review": " PART 1: STEVE\u2019S REVIEW4.0 to 4.5 stars. Written over a period of 7 years and published in 1966, this novel, while not technically the first \u201ctrue crime\u201d non-fiction novel, is credited (correctly) with establishing the genre and being the progenitor of today's true crime novel.

This should be on everyone's 'books to read in a lifetime' list. As many of you may know, In Cold Blood is the true account of the heinous murders of the Clutter Family in 1959 Kansas.
