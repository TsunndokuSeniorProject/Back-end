{"Name": "And Then There Were None", "Image": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1391120695l/16299.jpg", "Reviews": [{"Review": "Before I begin I would like to apologise for my use of the N word in this review. It is necessary, I promise.This book was originally published in UK under a charming title of \"Ten Little Niggers\". When it came to the US version in the 40's someone decided that 'Ten Little Niggers' is not the most marketable title for a book so they changed it to 'Ten Little Indians' (as it was still ok to call Native Americans Indians then).Only years after someone decided that neither 'Niggers', nor 'Indians' is a fortunate choice of words for the title so it was changed to 'And Then There Were None' - the last line of the nursery rhyme which in this new version was called 'Ten Boy Soldiers'.This is the version that I read and I must say I am glad. I think I would be rather uncomfortable reading something called 'The Little Niggers', which takes place on 'Nigger Island' (how did Christie want to pull this off? 'Nigger Island' off the Devon coast? Really? How?).The premise, I am sure you know, is this: ten people end up cut off from the world on a tiny island. One of them is a murderer and people keep dying as in the nursery rhyme. Every person on the island has a secret and is guilty of a murder. It's the kind of murder where law is helpless. Nothing can be proven. This is why they found themselves on that island, at the mercy of a prototype 'Jigsaw' madman who decided justice must be done.The premise requires the structure of the novel to be very organised and clean cut. I felt that it was only right for me to approach the reading of it in an equally disciplined way. I took five sheets of papers and divide each in half, thus ending up with ten cards, one for each character.And I continued to dilligently fill them out with all the details I learnt about the characters until about halfway through the book when I became too engrossed, frightened and nervous. I already had an inkling as to who the murderer was and was petrified I would be murdered in my sleep as well. The situation was very serious and I had to invite all my teddy bears back to my bed, so they could protect me.I grew to like two of the characters - the sentiment, I think, I shared with Christie as she liked them so, she killed them last.This was my second Christie, and the first proper one. The first one I read was a bit of a mishap spy novel, so Christie's brilliance wasn't as apparent as it was in 'And Then There Were None'. UPDATE: Now that I've read a couple more Christie's books I realise that random casual racism and antisemitism was very much her trademark. It's almost amazing she could sneak racism into books that have no black characters at all. Really off-putting and uncomfortable. 4.5 starsPS> Thanks to karen I have just found this page - betterbooktitlesAnd here is their take on Ms Christie:"}, {"Review": "\u064a\u062c\u0628 \u0623\u0646

At least that's what the mastermind behind it all believes.But the question is - who has the right to decide what justice is? And who is to decide what punishment serves the crime? And is perceived justice at all costs the ultimate goal, or is it the frequently pointless work of a maniac? As a matter of fact, what is justice after all?I think the story of this book (the one that may win the contest for the most offensive original title, after all) is familiar to most readers. It is a lovely and fascinating idea. Ten people are lured onto a remote island under false pretenses just to realize that they are all about to be punished by death for the 'crimes' that they have committed in the past and have gotten away with. Killed in a manner predicted by a silly yet ominous children's poem with the conclusion of \"... and then there were none\". What's more, they come to realize that the mastermind - or maniac? - has to be among them. And the (very polite, in the traditional British way) game of survival begins, complete with all the necessary societal rituals\u00b9 and classism\u00b2 that are not disposed of even under the threat of imminent demise.\u00b9The politeness and overt show of respect to one another even in the face of imminent murder by someone in their midst - because, of course, you would not want to offend anyone. Continuing to socialize and take meals together. Insisting on chivalry when a woman could be the murderer just as well as a man ((view spoiler)[this viewing of women as shrinking violets was what cost Philip Lombard his life in the end! (hide spoiler)]) - these are just some of the examples.\u00b2 Just think of everyone expecting the impeccable service by the butler even though HIS WIFE JUST DIED! Everyone deciding to stick together and be careful - but never including the servants in it. The belief by some that people of 'proper class' would be incapable of murder ((view spoiler)[Doctor Amstrong becomes a victim of just this reasoning (hide spoiler)]). The list can go on and on. And all of these assumptions prove to be wrong.And as, despite the precautions, the number of people trapped on the island continues to decline, the uneasy tension sets in, and the impeccable facades begin to crack.\"The oth\u00aders went up\u00adstairs, a slow unwilling pro\u00adces\u00adsion. If this had been an old house, with creak\u00ading wood, and dark shad\u00adows, and heav\u00adily pan\u00adelled walls, there might have been an eerie feel\u00ading. But this house was the essence of moder\u00adni\u00adty. There were no dark corners - \u200bno possi\u00adble slid\u00ading pan\u00adels - it was flood\u00aded with elec\u00adtric light - everything was new and bright and shining. There was nothing hid\u00adden in this house, noth\u00ading con\u00adcealed. It had no at\u00admo\u00adsphere about it. Some\u00adhow, that was the most fright\u00aden\u00ading thing of all. They ex\u00adchanged good-\u200bnights on the up\u00adper land\u00ading. Each of them went in\u00adto his or her own room, and each of them automatical\u00adly, al\u00admost with\u00adout con\u00adscious thought, locked the door.\"The story is captivating and very smart, and the ending had me baffled for a bit the first time I read it. It has a neat resolution despite an obvious plot hole (view spoiler)[ - Wargrave's brains will be all over the bed on which he was NOT supposed to have died! (hide spoiler)]. It's an enjoyable read to say the least. But what made me unsettled both of the times I read it was the nagging question of justice, as I mentioned above. Yes, on one hand, it's almost poetic justice to punish the criminals who thought they got away with it. On the other hand, is eye-for-an-eye the best way to get even? And who's to judge, anyway? Who is either conceited enough or deranged enough to assume that he has the right and the moral authority to determine guilt and the extent of punishment just like that?Don't get me wrong - the people accused on the island are undeniably guilty (even though it's not necessarily murder as we think of for some of them - Vera Claythorne is really guilty of neglect, albeit with a desire to kill, and Emily Brent is pretty much guilty of being a judgmental \u00fcber-righteous heartless prude). But the degree of their guilt varies quite significantly in my perception, and it does not always coincide with what their 'unknown' judge/executioner thinks (running two children over with a car and feeling no remorse is to me worse than firing a pregnant servant who then goes on to kill herself, for instance). And is arbitrarily and single-handedly determining their guilt and doling out punishments not just as much (or even much worse) or a crime than they have committed? Conceited, self-righteous crime? Decide for yourself. Speaking of guilt - this novel has quite a bit to say on this subject. You see, many of the characters have already been judged and condemned by their own selves. Vera Claythorne and General Macarthur both are tormented by their guilt (and (view spoiler)[Vera actually becomes a direct victim of it, after all, becoming her own executioner in the rather creepy and effective scene (hide spoiler)]). Interestingly, others, no less guilty, are not tormented by their conscience at all. But ultimately this does not matter at all for their survival; only the fact that they were deemed guilty ((view spoiler)[except for Vera, as I mentioned above. Remorseless Philip Lombard would not have cracked like she did, had he been the one holding the revolver a few minutes earlier (hide spoiler)]). So should being tormented by guilt versus a cold-blooded killer factor at all in the administration of justice?These are the thoughts that kept running through my head as I was reading this excellent non-traditional critically-acclaimed specimen of mystery literature. And therefore bravo to Miss Christie for making me think and care - and not just mindlessly flipping pages to get to the bottom of the whodunit. Because 'WHO' was much less important to me than 'HOW' and 'WHY' - especially 'WHY'. For all of this, I give it the unflinching guilt-free 4 stars."}, {"Review": "I'm a big lover of Agatha Christie, she has written some fantastic murder mysteries and her stories never get tiring. But this is the one that just comes out on top every time.It partly, and quite amusingly, reminds me of that old American murder mystery in Sunset Beach. Basically, they're the only ones on this island and someone is killing them off one by one in accordance with the Ten Little Indians rhyme . And I swear I never saw it coming, and I'm usually very good at it. It's just a very clever novel, full of mystery and suspense and easily quite frightening at times.I like how Agatha Christie doesn't have to write a 500 page novel with a massive back story, her mysteries are very simply put together but always clever and hard to decipher. I would recommend this book to everyone."}, {"Review": "5 stars to Agatha Christie's And Then There Were None. This is the book that started my absolute love of the mystery genre. I was addicted and must have read it 3 or 4 times over the course of the year. Between the poem, the deserted island, the plot twist, the count-down, the pure clandestine suspense... it couldn't get any better.\nStory\nTen people receive a mystery letter from someone they don't know that indicates they should come to a remote island. Why would they go????? After arriving, they try to figure out the connection between all of them while waiting for their mysterious host. After coming across a cute little poem about how ten little indians die, they decide they will wait it out until the next morning when the ferry comes back to take them home. But it will never come! Each guest suddenly dies matching the line from the poem... resulting in alliances and mistrust. Pure fun.In a masterful conclusion, the reader understands all the connections, learns why the killer chose them to die and develops a very distinct opinion on who was right and who was wrong in this story.Amazing!\nStrengths\n1. Plot - can you get any better than telling the reader that 10 people will die and then guessing the order and the weapon?2. Characters - All walks of life, all personalities. You'll love some and hate some!\nWeaknesses\n1. Only that there wasn't a follow-up... \nFinal Thoughts\nIf you are a mystery fan, you must read this. If you've never read Agatha Christie, this must be your first - before you tackle Miss Marple or Hercule Poirot. You must understand the master before getting hooked on any specific protagonist in one of her other series."}, {"Review": "Reread: 2015Because some Non-Crunchy Cool Classic Pantaloonless friends thought I read it wrong...Turns out, I did. This was a really good mystery!{insert long-winded apology with much groveling}Happy, guys?The story goes a bit like this:10 strangers each get invitations from someone they think they know, to stay on an island resort. Hells yeah! Sunshine & sea air!Well, resort is a bit of a misnomer. It's really a big house on an island. Still, it's famous for being a party place, and nobody in the group turns it down.BIG MISTAKE.Almost as soon as everyone is gathered together, a recorded voice booms out through the walls and accuses each of them of being a murderer. And not just...YOU'RE ALL MURDERERS! Nope, whoever it is appears to know specific details about each death, and why these particular people were responsible.Of course, everyone immediately starts proclaiming their innocence!Wha..? Noooo! That person died accidentally! I was never even a suspect! Who dares...?! Harrumph & bluster!However, within minutes one of them falls over dead.Suicide? Or something more nefarious?!As the body count rises, they have to face the facts that these aren't accidents. And with each new death coinciding with a children's rhyme that's tacked up in each room, all signs point to a self-appointed executioner in their midst.After they get organized and take a peek around, they realize that they are quite alone on this island. Their mysterious benefactor must be disguised as one of the guests, and is more than likely...the murderer.Dum, dum, duuuuum!The tension ratchets up with each body, and the guests start turning on each other in an attempt to ferret out the killer. Eventually, they decide they just need to calm down and survive till the police can get to the island. Good plan, right? But what if there isn't anyone left to tell the cops what happened?So whodunit? I ain't tellin'.Psst. The epilogue is really important."}, {"Review": " \u201cWatch and pray. The day of judgement is at hand.\u201d  Now I understand why Agatha is the Queen of crime! This was addictive.

Things become even more peculiar when their host isn\u2019t there when they arrive, and doesn\u2019t show themselves at all. One by one the guests are killed, picked off, leaving the others terrified and paranoid. It was a fantastic mystery throughout. As tension becomes hysteria, the guests wonder who will be next, who is responsible for these murders and why?A fantastic read that leaves you guessing until the very end.  \u201cWe shall none of us leave this island.\u201d  ******************************So creepy! RTC"}, {"Review": "This year I have decided to take part in a women's century challenge in the group catching up on classics where the participants read a book written in ten consecutive decades. I chose to focus on the 20th century and my 1930s selection is And Then There Were None by Agatha Christie. Although I had previously read some of her Hercule Poirot cases, this is my first stand alone mystery of Christie's that I have read. A suspenseful premise for a case, And Then There Were None left me on edge for the duration of the book. Ten individuals who committed murder at one point in their lives have been invited to Soldier Island for a supposed holiday. Upon arrival, the participants note the quaintness of the island and the home which they are staying in. Yet, on top of the mantel in each bedroom is the poem \"ten little Indians\". In the communal dining room are ten salt shakers each representing a person and the same poem. As the group gathers for cocktail hour, a gramophone recording announces the crime each individual is guilty of committing. Shocked at first, each person comes to terms with the accusation and reveals what really happened to the group. Christie's participants represent a cross section of society including a judge, doctor, Scotland Yard police officer, retired general, mercenary, governess, and spinster. None of these primary participants believes themselves guilty of the crime because after all they were acquitted. Yet one of their party believes them all to be guilty, or they would not have been invited to Soldier Island. One by one the group is murdered, the island is searched, and the dwindling group realizes that there is a murderer in their midst. The death mirrors the poem on the wall, and as each person is killed, another salt shaker breaks. It is up to the remaining people to identify the murder. Unlike Hercule Poirot cases where Christie allows the reader to crack the case early on only to have Poirot peal back layers and layers to the case, in And Then There Were None, Dame Christie does not clue us as to who the murderer is. Even someone as myself who reads a fair number of mysteries was left captivated as to whodunit, allowing me to read quickly until the end of the book. The participants were also held in suspense, accusing each other of being the murderer. This lead to a revealing denouement, one that had me guessing until the last page. I have read many mysteries written by women, including many cases starring female private eyes and police detectives. Many of these mystery writers have Dame Agatha Christie to thank for paving their way as early as the 1920s. And Then There Were None first appeared in serial form, leaving its readers in suspense until the next installment appeared. A captivating mystery, I am open to reading more of Christie's stand alone cases, and rate this mystery 4 stars. "}, {"Review": "\u201cWhen the sea goes down, there will come from the mainland boats and men. And they will find ten dead bodies and an unsolved problem on Soldier Island.\u201dMy first Agatha Christie, and a good one indeed. And Then There Were None just recently came to my attention. Maybe it was the new mini-series or the many people suddenly reading this, but I was intrigued immediately. I can't wait to watch the series!Agatha Christie totally tricked me. I thought I had figured it out, but I was wrong. This novel turned out to be exactly what it promised. A murder mystery, a mad psychothriller of a book. I would have liked a little more detail and character depth, but I have nothing to criticise in general. Would highly recommend.Find more of my books on Instagram"}, {"Review": "Extraordinary and gripping novel!I knew that the best way to start reading the literary work by Agatha Christie was choosing her most known book. And There were none is the best-selling mystery novel of all time with 100 million of copies, and the fifth book in the list comprehending all genres. That is something to give to Agatha Christie the respect that she deserves.Initially this novel on UK was titled Ten Little Niggers, only because the original nursery rhyme was called that but it was obviously seen as racist, then in USA was decided to change the title to Ten Little Indians, but again obviously as seen as racist again, so at the end the title was changed to And There were none, and the nursery rhyme inside the book was changed to \"Ten Little Soldiers\", curiously enough none member of any army so far as pointed out as racist that final change. I mean, the title was just because a widely known nursery rhyme and none character on the book was afro-american or native-american. To this, I want to comment that it's lucky that not many children would had more nightmares since a lot of nursery rhymes have truly scary lyrics. No wonder in stuff like A Nightmare on Elm Street and Saphire and Steel were used nursery rhymes with truly scary effects.Returning to the novel, it was a remarkable reading. Great atmosphere where you feel as trapped as those people on that island.I want to comment that at some point I figured it out who was the murderer, don't worry, I won't tell it, and I have no doubt that some would say: \"Oh, sure! I believe you Sherlock!\". However I do indeed discovered it. This is not my first mystery story. I have read several books in the genre and I have watched a lot of TV shows like Murder, She Wrote, Columbo, Criminal Minds, CSI: Miami, etc... And while that doesn't turn me into a detective, in my defense, I knew who was only because I focused on the \"why\" and not the \"how\" that certainly I didn't know that. You can say that I did an amateur criminal profile and that helped me to have a suspect of my own that it resulted true. Also, I had some advantage for being Spanish speaking since there is a clue that only can be detected due that not matter that I read the novel on English, but taking in account the very detail that it's indeed a printed novel, I catched something and putting together some clues. Well, I figured it out. Believe or not. It doesn't matter.Anyway, I think that many of the fun of reading this kind of mystery novels is trying to figure out the culprit during the process of reading the book. Not matter if you guess right or not, always it's rewarding when the mystery is explained. A delicious way to make your neurons to exercise.Again, knowing who was, or at least thinking that I knew who was, since obviously I couldn't confirm it until reading the whole book, it didn't help me to know how everything was made until it was explained on the novel. Definitely, Agatha Christie is the queen of mystery!Certainly, this novel isn't only a marvellous detective mystery book but also a truly scary horror story. Priceless setting for a scenario and fantastic twisted character developing.\nAppendix: (July 23rd, 2014)\nThe clue that I found thanks that I am a born Spanish-language speaker:WARNING!!! WARNING!!! WARNING!!! WARNING!!!Read ONLY if you already read the novel, since this is a mega-spoiler telling who the culprit is!I seldom put spoilers in my reviews, but I wrote this appendix basically since I was contacted by several readers asking me about the \"big clue\" and well, while I don't mind to share it, well, also I don't want to find out later that it was written down in some other review as theirs, taking in account that it seems that only me were the one who noticed that.(view spoiler)[Ok, the big fuzz about the clue that I found is that the first character that you find in the novel is Mr. Justice Wargrave on the chapter one, you may say: \"So what?\", well, the mysterious couple who invited to all guests, the initials of both names of them are U.N.O., in the imaginary woman is \"Una Nancy Owen\" and the supposed husband is \"U.N. Owen. U.N.O. that in Spanish can be spelled just like \"uno\" which means \"one\" on English. Maybe that a coincidence, but with Agatha Christie nothing can be left to chance, so I think that may be a clue targeted to the readers with knowledge about Spanish language.

Every once in a while on Goodreads I find myself feeling compelled to make a True Confession, and here's another one: I'm not all that much of a Hercule Poirot fan. For someone who's read probably 30 or 40 Agatha Christie books over her lifetime, that's probably an odd thing. I like him okay, I don't DISlike him, but yeah, he kind of irks me sometimes. So when I'm picking up an Agatha Christie mystery, I'm always a little bit tickled when it doesn't involve Poirot. This is one of those books, so it already had a leg up on the competition when I started it.And here's the other thing: with all the Christie books I've read in my lifetime, there are only a handful that I've found really memorable. This, again, is one of those books. In fact, plotwise I would say it's my favorite Christie book of all time. Many Christie fans consider it her masterpiece.Eight very different people are invited to an isolated island off the coast of England. Fairly soon it becomes apparent that they all have one thing in common: they've all been accused of murder but were never convicted or brought to justice. Each person has gotten a written invitation to the island, tailored to their needs or situation, like a job offer or a holiday invitation, most of the invitations coming from someone they don't know who signs the invites as U.N. Owen. Together with the butler and cook who are already on the island, there are ten people. They gather for drinks and to meet their U.N.Known host. While they are waiting, a few things happen:1. They notice a framed copy of the nursery rhyme \"Ten Little Indians\" hanging on the wall, in which the Indians* leave, die or disappear one by one, until there are none. There are also ten Indian figurines on the dining room table. 2. Mysteriously, a recorded voice begins to speak, describing each of the characters in turn and accusing them each of committing murder but evading justice . . . until now. 3. One of the guests laughs off the shock and quickly downs a drink. And immediately chokes and dies. One of the ten figurines is soon discovered to be broken, and the nursery rhyme reflects his manner of death (\"One choked his little self and then there were nine\").So begins an intense tale, as the guests frantically try to protect themselves and figure out which of them is the killer (or is it someone else hiding on the island?) before they are all dead. And at the same time, they're all dealing with their own feelings of guilt to varying degrees. And the figurines keep disappearing--DUN! DUN! DUN! The psychological exploration in this book is great, beyond anything I recall reading in any other Christie mystery, and the reveal at the end completely surprised me.*Content note: For the record, some readers may have qualms with this nearly 80-year-old novel's dicey history of racial slurs and insensitivity. It was originally actually titled Ten Little Niggers, based on the British version of this poem, which apparently wasn't considered offensive enough not to use in England when the book was first published in 1939. For the American edition of the book, it was changed to \"Ten Little Indians\" and, later, \"And Then There Were None\" (which is the version I have, but still with the Indian poem and figurines) - better but still not great. I understand that many recent editions now use ten little soldiers for the poem."}, {"Review": "\n\"Ten literary Goodreads reviewers chatting online;One bot was discovered and then there were Nine.Nine literary Goodreads reviewers on a thread until late;One lost his Wi-Fi signal and then there were Eight.Eight literary Goodreads reviewers groupreading Austen;One only read males and then there were Seven.Seven literary Goodreads reviewers averse to using pics;One blasphemed with GIFs and then there were Six.Six literary Goodreads reviewers booktubing live;One revealed too much and then there were Five.Five literary Goodreads reviewers trying out Coelho;One rushed back home and then there were Four.Four literary Goodreads reviewers adored Harper Lee;One sequel led to suicide and then there were Three.Three literary Goodreads reviewers re-reading Pooh;One thought it only for children and then there were Two.Two literary Goodreads reviewers engrossed in Hamsun;One died of hunger and then there was One.One literary Goodreads reviewer left all alone;He deleted his account and then there were None.\"\nOriginal:\n\"Ten little soldier boys went out to dine;One choked his little self and then there were Nine.Nine little soldier boys sat up very late;One overslept himself and then there were Eight.Eight little soldier boys travelling in Devon;One said he'd stay there and then there were Seven.Seven little soldier boys chopping up sticks;One chopped himself in halves and then there were Six.Six little soldier boys playing with a hive;A bumblebee stung one and then there were Five.Five little soldier boys going in for law;One got in Chancery and then there were Four.Four little soldier boys going out to sea;A red herring swallowed one and then there were Three.Three little soldier boys walking in the Zoo;A big bear hugged one and then there were Two.Two little soldier boys sitting in the sun;One got frizzled up and then there was One.One little soldier boy left all alone;He went and hanged himself and then there were None.\"\nLoved the idea of this novel.October 21, 2015"}, {"Review": "And Then There Were None is one of Agatha Christie's most celebrated mystery novels, and purportedly one of the most difficult for her to write. I don't dislike this book. It seems to be a favorite among many, but it's very middle of the road for me as far as Mystery/Thriller books go. \nThe Good:\nI enjoy the setup & how this mystery is structured. It's fun & easy to engage with in a \"Gee, I sure am glad I'm not in their shoes\" kind of way. It's written well with an accurate insight on human desperation & how psychosomatic effects can drastically warp one's sense of control. The length (only 264 pages) & pacing of this novel is very appropriate. It gives adequate page space to the mystery & the characters, acquainting the reader quickly with the situation so that we can dive straight into the action.\nThe Bad:\nI did not care about even one of these characters past seeing the creative ways the author would kill them off. They're developed & believable as people, but I never felt any type of connection or sympathy which I think can be quite important in a story like this.Sometimes the characters don't matter or can get away with being stereotypical cardboard cutouts, but that tends to shift the over into the torture porn arena & I don't believe for a second that is where Christie's book belongs.Probably the most disappointing part of my experience, I was not impressed with the conclusion of this mystery. Right off the bat, I didn't feel engaged with the actual solving of the problem because it felt as though I was kept at an arm's length from any of the potential clues. Call me an idiot, maybe this was obvious for other people? But I genuinely don't feel as though readers are given a chance to make even an a semi-educated guess about who the perpetrator is.It relies wholly on the very, very last section of the book to lay out the details for what they are & explain the unknown bits. It's very: \"Oh, by the way here's what happened.\"Anti-climactic to say the least.When I'm reading a Mystery/Thriller, I want to feel as though I'm being challenged to figure out what's happening before the characters do. I'll be the first to admit I almost never guess the truth in its entirety, but that's beside the point. I was to the point where I was almost ready to believe something supernatural was happening. Not a great sign.When the truth is finally exposed, I had a hard time feeling as startled as I'm meant to feel because I've seen this story before in popular media. Now, this came out in the 1930's and so this isn't by any means the fault of the book itself. It probably came first in every instance I'm thinking of. But as a modern reader this didn't pack the same punch it might have if I were a reader of the 1930's. Anyhow, that's another classic under the belt!"}, {"Review": "Wow! This is a masterpiece! Dame Agatha Christie's achievement is remarkable. She creates ten characters, all suspected of murder, who are lured to an island. She has them meet their deaths one by one as nominated in the nursery rhyme \"Ten Little Indians\" which is displayed in their rooms. She has each murder occur in a situation where almost all the other island guests might have had opportunity to commit it. Set on an isolated island without contact of the outside civilization, a group of ten strangers are invited for a long weekend on Indian Island, a mile off the Devon coast. They include a doctor, a games mistress, a soldier of fortune, a rich playboy, a retired policeman, a judge, a spinster, a retired general and a married couple who are to be the servants. They arrive on a bleak rocky island to a completely modern house with all the amenities. The fires are welcoming, there is an ample supply of food, the servants are impeccable, but their host is absent. In each of the bedrooms, the \"Ten Little Indians\" nursery rhyme is posted on a prominent wall.It's a great book and is very scary with loads of suspense. A thriller that will definitely keep your pulse pounding. I love the setting on the island, with no phone or transportation. Just think, getting stuck on an island with a mad man. That sounds pretty creepy. This is my favourite book of all time! And Then There Were None probably ranks among the BEST works of crime fiction ever written. I highly recommend everyone to get a copy of this book :)"}, {"Review": "\u0397 \u03b1\u03be\u03af\u03b1 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03b7 \u03b3\u03bf\u03b7\u03c4\u03b5\u03af\u03b1 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5

am a late, reluctant and suspicious convert to Christie. I avoided her studiously as an adolescent, because dozens and dozens of her paperbacks were always on sale with equally cheap indistinguishable romances and other 'women's books,' and I wanted no part of those. I read Chandler, not Christie; Hammett, not Sayers; James, not Marsh. I even read a few Spillane books, for Chrissakes, at a friend's urging (UGH), but still no Christie. Those endless TV adaptations, with the dotty Miss Marple and dorky Poirot, didn't help either. I had her books written off - predictable - cozy - tricksy - unreal - feminine. I liked Patricia Cornwell and noir. Show me a grisly procedural and I'll sink into it like a warm bath.The result of this prejudice, of course, was that I never saw what was actually there and only cheated myself. But matters weren't helped when I took a (delightful) genre studies course in graduate school (The Singing Sands, Ashenden, Knight's Gambit, An Unsuitable Job for a Woman, Poe, Doyle....) and we had to read The Murder of Roger Ackroyd, about whom legendary snob Edmund Wilson famously asked: Who Cares? Not me. (Not that I cared for Wilson either.) I hated that book.But during that course I ran across something interesting. For my final topic I chose the work of P.D. James (and read all of her books published up til then - through Original Sin - in about a month; dizzying but v fun) and you couldn't miss emblazoned on all her paperbacks at the time, THE NEW QUEEN OF CRIME, SHE USURPS CHRISTIE'S THRONE, CAGEMATCH BETWEEN PHYLLIS AND AGATHA, TWO BITCHES ENTER ONE NOVELIST LEAVES, &c &c you get the picture. This was mainly very stupid marketing because James and Christie have almost nothing in common (even tho James's first, derivative novel had the classic locked-room scenario). But I read a lot of interviews with James, and while she was polite about Christie (well, she's British) I sensed something else: respect. Apparently her tone's changed a bit in her most recent nonfiction book about mysteries, but then she said something like: 'She is a conjurer with those cards, and each time you think you know which one she is turning face-up, and each time you are wrong.' Well, now that was interesting. Every time? And I discovered the answer is, yes, pretty much. Call it a trick, call it a gimmick, call it masterful puzzle-plotting, call it a kind of genius, whatever it is, it's frighteningly consistent. It is what Stephen King terms the 'gotta' in Misery raised almost to an art form. It is what Magnus Eisengrim describes in Robertson Davies' World of Wonders as what makes a great magician: 'A man who can stand stark naked in the middle of a crowd and keep it gaping for an hour while he manipulates a few coins, or cards, or billiard balls.'This would have been a far, far better book for me to read in that class that was almost fifteen years ago now (gosh). For one thing, it has a sharp, strong, original female central character (she's not quite a heroine); its gimmick is equally as good as Ackroyd's; and it is a dazzling distinctive example of the One-Of-Us-is-a-Murderer-But-Which-One plot. Even better, there is no trace of that horrific Socratic bore Hercule Poirot or any of his little grey cells. For all that critics harp on Christie's cardboard characters and outlandish setups, this book depends largely on characterization and atmosphere. Each of the ten people brought to a deserted, barren island is guilty to a greater or lesser degree of causing the death of another person, and the book becomes almost a meditation on - what is guilt? What is responsibility? The murderer isn't just randomly cutting people down, but manipulating them, and enjoying it. Even if they are all as guilty as she or he thinks they are, do they deserve to be picked off and psychologically tortured? What justifies passing sentence on someone else? These are not easy questions and Christie does not give easy answers.(Also trying to write a spoiler-free review of this is hard, yeesh.)"}, {"Review": "Ten little Indian boys went out to dine; One choked his little self and then there were nine.\u200b\u200bNo wonder this is considered to be the best book of Agatha Christie's ever - it is truly a masterpiece. Nine little Indian boys sat up very late; One overslept himself and then there were eightAnd I am not just saying it- I truly mean it. I didn't just discovered it and am not speaking on a high rush of that fresh new read feeling - this was a re-read for me. And I don't re-read books very often - only the BEST OF BEST makes my re-reads list. Eight little Indian boys travelling in Devon; One said he'd stay there and then there were seven.\u200bIf you have read anything of Agatha Christie before and wasn't a big fan - read this. This novel is completely stand alone and it doesn't feature Miss Marple or Poirot, like all of her other books do. Despite being first published in 1939 this novel is timeless, it reads extremely easily. It's an absolute CLASSIC without that heavy classic feel. Seven little Indian boys chopping up sticks; One chopped himself in halves and then there were six.The book starts out with clever introductions to our 10 characters all of whom intertwine somehow on the way to the Soldier Island, to where they were all invited. And then - and then shit goes down! Six little Indian boys playing with a hive; A bumblebee stung one and then there were five.Christie plays with human psyche and emotions wonderfully in this book. She brings out guilt, paranoia and distrust. It's so tangible you can almost feel it seeping through the pages. Five little Indian boys going in for law; One got in Chancery and then there were four.I have mentioned that this ia a re-read for me. I read this for the first time about 5 years ago (at least) and because of this I couldn't really remember what happened. So, reading it again felt new and exciting! BUT, I also feel like even if I remembered the ending I'd still have enjoyed it just as much. Because then I'd have just looked for clues, for giveaways and hints on how to solve the mystery. Four little Indian boys going out to sea; A red herring swallowed one and then there were three.This book is one of my all time favorites, and to be honest not many books can beat that. I always find something to dislike if I read books more than once (as the more I read the more critical I get). Three little Indian boys walking in the Zoo; A big bear hugged one and then there were two.I found some things that I didn't think clear answers were given to in the book, but nothing major, and nothing that could have disappointed me. For this read focuses on atmosphere, on emotions and on quick pace of events that just don't give you time to catch your breath. Or to put the book away...Two little Indian boys sitting in the sun; One got frizzled up and then there was one.And because it is so atmospherically mysterious and creepy, it's a perfect October read! Highly, highly recommend! Bravo Agatha Christie, BRAVO!One little Indian boy left all alone; He went and hanged himself and then there were none.My WEBSITEMy INSTAGRAMMy WORDPRESS BLOG"}, {"Review": "I read this book ages ago; I believe it was my very first Agatha Christie book. I recall searching through the shelves of the local library in the mystery section trying to find something I hadn\u2019t already read. This was during a phase when all I wanted to read were mysteries and nothing else \u2013 I suppose I was attempting to create some sort of balance with the high school required reading curriculum. I have to admit that I don\u2019t think I had ever heard of Agatha Christie until that moment. (My parents and grandparents were non-readers, so I was generally on my own to discover new books and authors \u2013 unless it was assigned reading.) Imagine my delight when I noted a whole slew of her mysteries all lined up neatly on the shelf \u2013 more to look forward to if I liked my first! To make a long story short, I loved the book and to this day recalled the clever twist at the end.When one of my book groups chose to read this last month, I didn\u2019t think I would manage to squeeze it in. Then I discovered the BBC audio production. I don\u2019t generally listen to audio books; my mind tends to wander far too easily. However, since I\u2019d read it before I thought this would be a fun option. And it was! But it was far too short! All of a sudden it ended and I thought there was something more to be heard! I know there was something missing\u2026 my memory of it all those years ago told me so. I wasn\u2019t even sure whodunit when the audio ended. So I promptly returned to the library and signed out the actual book, which includes both an epilogue as well as a copy of a \u2018manuscript\u2019 found in a sealed bottle out at sea. Whew! All my questions were answered and it all came together quite brilliantly once again. What I came to realize was that my \u2018audio book\u2019 was more like a recording of a dramatization \u2013 missing all the little details I\u2019d have read in the actual book, but with the addition of all the sound effects and plenty of engaging dialogue - ice tinkling in glasses, music fading, doors slamming, different voices for the various characters\u2026 but lacking the narration in between that helped make the story solid. An entertaining and very slick little mystery, And Then There Were None should appeal to most lovers of this genre. I recommend reading the actual book or the true audio book rather than the BBC dramatization, unless you are already familiar with the story. Otherwise, this version would make for great fun! 3.5 stars rounded up"}, {"Review": "To talk about the plot of this book however briefly would give spoilers right away. For people who have not read them, spoilers kill Agatha Christie books. Basically there is a small isolated island bought by an American millionaire which was later sold to a mysterious party generating a lot of rumors about the latest buyer. A group of very different people ended up on the island.If you are familiar with the Dame of Mystery's writing you would guess there will be a murder. If you have read several books of her, you know she rarely stops at just one dead body. This is all. I insist that nobody comes anywhere close to Christie when it comes creating a complicated exciting and fair mystery - both before or after her, up to this day. British people seems to agree with me as they made her a Dame for her contribution to literature. I am sure quite a few readers from other countries fully agree. This book is considered to be her best by many. At this point I could just stop and would still consider my review to be complete and the reasons for my rating clearly explained. The images used are from the Soviet movie Desyat Negrityat (\u0414\u0435\u0441\u044f\u0442\u044c \u043d\u0435\u0433\u0440\u0438\u0442\u044f\u0442) which is still the only movie adaptation of the book which remain completely true to its source material. What is it about movie people insisting on making changes to a classic of mystery? Are they trying to improve the perfection? This is doomed to failure. The final conclusion: if you like mysteries or thrillers (this book successfully combines both) this one is a must read. Can you guess what is going on before the epilogue? It is actually quite simple if you think about it, but there are a lot of red herrings to hide the answer in the plain sight. My special thanks go to Erin for the book discussion.

Ten strangers are invited to Soldier Island under mysterious circumstances. When their unknown benefactor doesn\u2019t show, things on the island get crazy. The guests start dying off, one by one, in eerie accordance with the Ten Little Soldier Boys poem that is posted in nearly every room of the estate.And Then There Were None is only my second experience with Agatha Christie, and I wasn\u2019t disappointed. Just as Murder on the Orient Express left me guessing until the final chapter, I had absolutely no idea who was responsible for the murder and mayhem in And Then There Were None. I was honestly afraid that I would never find out whodunnit when I reached the end of the epilogue and still wasn\u2019t given any answers. Thankfully answers were provided right at the very end of the novel, and I was completely blindsided by those answers.I might only have two of her books under my belt, but I already understand why Christie is considered the queen of the mystery genre. She plays things so close to the chest that it\u2019s nearly impossible to guess anything until she feeds you the information you need. It\u2019s amazing to me that books written this long ago can still be so surprising and mysterious and feel so fresh.

From now on, it is our task to suspect each and every one amongst us. Forewarned is forearmed. Take no risks and be alert to danger. That is all.\"I had never read this classic \u201clocked-room\u201d mystery, which is actually an isolated-island mystery. Written in 1939, nearly 80 years ago, it\u2019s obvious there will be no helicopters doing either retrievals or midnight drops of surprise visitors. And there\u2019s no telephone communication, so when the weather turns, the island is truly isolated from the mainland.At one, point, a few (\u201cremaining\u201d) characters decide to heliograph the mainland, hoping someone will notice mirrors flashing code. But Christie has that covered, too. The island used to belong to an eccentric American, so mainlanders are used to ignoring the antics of the quirky parties held there. The story. Ten people have received personal invitations to holiday on Indian Island as the guests of someone from their past. When all finally arrive by boat and begin to compare notes, it\u2019s obvious that nobody is quite sure who their host is.To greet them, there are figurines of ten little Indians on the dining table, and in each room there hangs a copy of a nursery rhyme, somewhat adapted for the occasion. It tells what happens to each little Indian until the last one is gone \u2013 and then there were none.As each \u201cguest\u201d succumbs to a different fate\u2014well, no, the same fate, murder most foul\u2014the remaining suspects/victims try to figure out how to stay together while staying safe from each other. One has a revolver (he\u2019s an ex-copper, invited to keep an eye on things, he says). It\u2019s a fiendishly clever plot with good reason to suspect everyone. Each of them has a secret in their murky past, and I must admit when I found out what they were, I reckoned they deserved to be scared out of their wits. And they were!\u201cThe candle was burning down. Looking to see if the matches were within easy reach of his hand, he blew it out. Strangely enough, he found the darkness disquieting. It was as though a thousand age-old fears awoke and struggled for supremacy in his brain.\u201dI probably wouldn\u2019t have finished them off, but the killer was determined to carry out his or her plan. I did have to suspend disbelief a bit, but then I have to remember when this took place and where, and how absolutely terrified the suspects/victims were. Worth a read if you\u2019ve never read it."}, {"Review": "I'm a confirmed puzzle lover. Crosswords, sudoko, Scrabble, Clue, card games. I love them all. Puzzle love extends to my go-to lit genre. The way an author crafts a mystery with a surprise yet plausible ending is the best in my book (pun, intended). There is so much fun to be had in gathering clues and solving the puzzle the author has created.That is all the more reason the confession I have to make is deeply shameful. This is the first Agatha Christie book I have ever read in my life.I know. I know. Go ahead and scorn me. I've scorned myself for years over this glaring omission in my library of loves.I did try. Given I was about thirteen at the time, it was nothing more than an ambitious plan to read Murder on the Orient Express after seeing the movie. I got no further than the first chapter, struggling with the formal prose.The distaste stayed in my mind far longer than necessary and despite laboring over classical literature for years in college, I still lingered with my teenage opinion that Agatha Christie is just \"too hard to read.\"BULLOCKS! (Excuse my English, but I'm feeling very British now.) As an adult reader, I still found the first 50 pages somewhat disorienting and slow to get started. After the story is set up and you settle into the quaint writing style, the pages fly and the spooky story is completely captivating.There are ten characters, of course, and they are all summoned by an unknown host to holiday on a small island. As the story unfolds, we see that each of the guests harbor a deep, dark guilty secret. This cast of quirky endearing characters is part of the story's charm. \u00a0The tale is told from an omniscient narrator. We get to know the characters from the outwardly image they present to the world. But, more importantly we are able to examine their deep-seated fears, panicky thoughts, and stubborn egos as their tender souls are laid wide open for the reader to examine.The Ten Little Soldiers nursery rhyme is prominently displayed both in the novel and in the vacation house the guests are secluded in. The tension ratchets up quickly. We all know what is coming. Murder. One by one. There are no outsiders on the island. Therefore, the murderer must be one of the ten. \u00a0A metaphorical time bomb starts ticking with the first murder because you know it is only a matter of time until everyone is dead. The dread and fear is palpable throughout the novel.The mystery seems absolutely impossible to solve as you read. After some of the crazy mysteries I've read over the years, I was all over the place trying to solve it. I had to keep reminding myself, this is not the best selling mystery in the world for nothing! There is no supernatural element here, it is not a dream, not a joke.It is a brilliantly constructed puzzle with one equally brilliant answer.Agatha Christie is a master puzzle crafter. The Best. Regarding the writing process for this novel, Dame Christie states, \"...the person who was really pleased with it was myself, for I knew better than any critic how difficult it had been.\"She knew she was a genius. Love it!"}, {"Review": "\u00a1Qu\u00e9 genialidad este libro! C\u00f3mo me encanta leer novelas que me impactan y que quedan en mi mente durante mucho tiempo...No soy un asiduo lector de novelas policiales. Es m\u00e1s, para ser sincero he le\u00eddo muy poco. Apenas los tres cuentos de Edgar Allan Poe (\u201cLos cr\u00edmenes de la calle Morgue\u201d, \u201cEl misterio de Marie Rog\u00eat\u201d y \u201cLa carta robada\u201d) que comenzaron con el g\u00e9nero, \u201cEstudio en escarlata\u201d de Sir Arthur Conan Doyle y un volumen de 800 p\u00e1ginas llamado \u201cDe Poe a Simenon: Antolog\u00eda de cuentos policiacos y de misterio\u201d (https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...) en los que aparecen cuentos de los m\u00e1s renombrados autores. Tengo pensado leer \u201cLa piedra lunar\u201d de Wilkie Collins en breve. Pero reconozco que siempre estoy leyendo otro tipo de libros.Pero comenc\u00e9 a ver que muchos lectores rese\u00f1aban con grandes elogios a este libro de Agatha Christie y cuando mucha gente coincide en lo mismo es imposible estar en el camino incorrecto. Es m\u00e1s, buscando en internet encontr\u00e9 que para mucha gente \u00e9ste es un de los tres mejores libros de las setenta y nueve novelas que escribi\u00f3 Agatha Christie y creo no me equivoqu\u00e9 en la elecci\u00f3n.La forma en la que est\u00e1 planteada la novela, desde la invitaci\u00f3n a cargo del enigm\u00e1tico Ulik Norman Owen (o Una Nancy Owen), que es una especie de aagrama, puesto que si reacomodamos las letras nos quedar\u00edamos con la palabra \u201cunknown\u201d, pasando por la canci\u00f3n de cuna sobre la cual se basan los asesinatos de las diez personas que son invitadas a la moderna mansi\u00f3n de la Isla del Negro, hasta la desaparici\u00f3n de las peque\u00f1as estatuitas de los negritos todo, absolutamente todo es controlado por la la mente criminal del anfitri\u00f3n con la delicada precisi\u00f3n de un reloj suizo.Sumado a esto nos encontramos que cada uno de los diez personajes lleva a cuestas su propio crimen, ese mismo por el cual Owen los condena a muerte. Luego nos encontraremos con toda la trama de asesinatos en serie para desembocar en un final sorprendente, inesperado y perfecto. Otro punto sobresaliente de la novela es que en \u201cDiez Negritos\u201d, m\u00e1s all\u00e1 de que hay un inspector de polic\u00eda involucrado, no hay un afamado y experto detective para develar el misterio de los asesinatos sino que debe ser los mismos invitados los que tendr\u00e1n que pensar y repensar en c\u00f3mo salvarse. Simplemente brillante.No creo que siga incursionando en este g\u00e9nero (m\u00e1s all\u00e1 del libro de Collins) puesto que r\u00e1pidamente cambio a otro tipo de literatura, pero reconozco que cuando leo este tipo de genialidades como la que pertrech\u00f3 Agatha Christie en \u201cDiez Negritos\u201d solo puedo deshacerme en palabras de admiraci\u00f3n para una mente tan brillante como la de esta gran escritora. Me saco un imaginario sombrero ante Agatha Christie, \u201cLa Reina del Cr\u00edmen\u201d, una verdadera genia."}, {"Review": "Buddy read with my boo Aqsa Full Review  \u201cTen little Indian boys going out to dine; one went and choked himself and then there were nine\u201d I was skeptical about reading this because it did not seem like a book I would enjoy: first of all, it\u2019s really old, second, it was a mystery book (the only mystery book I have read was \u2018one of us is lying\u2019 but that had other elements I liked such as YA and Romance) and third, it seemed more serious than books I enjoy. But I am glad I gave this a chance.This book reminded me of all the slasher movies I enjoy watching because they had the same elements: people isolated in a place with nowhere else to go, someone amongst them being a killer, secrets being revealed.This book is about 10 people who were enticed into coming to an island for different reasons by a \u201cMr Owen\u201d. Getting there, they realized that they had been tricked and that \u2018mr Owen\u2019 had other plans. Not only that, there might also be a murderer among them that is killing off people one, by one. Who could it be? What I liked - I enjoyed the mystery in general, finding out why each of them was chosen, and the secrets they were all hiding. - Although they were being killed in specific ways that were explained beforehand, I could not recall all the ways which made the book more interesting to me. I liked finding out how people died AFTER it happened and not before.- The people I suspected ended up dying so it was nice not to be right haha. Honestly, at one point I was caught between thinking the killer was one of them, someone else entirely, and something supernatural lmfao - I did not suspect the culprit at all and I loved learning about their reasons and their plans.  What I did not like - It took me awhile to start enjoying the book because the writing was at times difficult to understand which is understandable since the book was first published in the 30s. There were some times where I had to reread some lines to understand what was being said. Also, there were a lot of people being introduced at once and so it was hard figuring out who was who but that gets cleared up in later chapters- Although I enjoyed learning about the culprit\u2019s motive and plan, I was a bit sceptical that they were able to pull off such an elaborative scheme easily. And there were a lot of coincidences that just seemed far-fetched (view spoiler)[ Like how he just happens to randomly meet people who knew someone that committed a murder they could get away with  (hide spoiler)]. Anyways, those were small issues and I really enjoyed the book in general! My first Agatha Christie book and I\u2019m glad that I was not disappointed ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I can't believe I enjoyed a non-romantic, non-fantasy, classic book! Who would have thought!! I'm so proud (look ma, no hands) \ud83d\ude02I think I'm going to start reading mystery novels!!"}], "Genre": "Crime", "ID": "16299", "Desc": ""}
