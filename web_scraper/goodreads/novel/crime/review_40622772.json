Wasnt as great as Lucca, and the romance took a back seat to \"the family\" drama quite a few times, BUT it kept me very entertained and I loved both MCs ANNDDDDD the book was safe. I'm very much looking forward to Maria and Dominics book, and I'm happy to see Amo is just as miserable as ever. Still loving this series and the world Sarah Brianne has built.

There really isn\u2019t much interaction between Drago and Kat. When and how they fell in love is beyond me. There are maybe 3-4 scenes of them together. Too many side characters were present.
