{"Genre": "Crime", "Reviews": [{"Review": "Cards of Love: Five of Cups is more thriller, suspense and mystery than romance. I\u2019m not kidding\u2014Ian and Porter are together once. That\u2019s right. Once. If you\u2019re searching for passionate romance with this novella, you won\u2019t find it here. However, in saying that, this quick novella is actually good for what it is. Pacing is even. Characters are multi-dimensional. Story is jaw-dropping. Writing very poetic that will draw you into its story-telling. Ending was totally unexpected and mind-boggling.

She surprised me at every turn, from the all male POV, to the sarcastic humor, to the more personal feel and the blasting of the fourth wall! She changed it up, worked her magic and had me under her spell. With all that is different, somethings remain the same. In Five of Cups, the darkness is a bit more subtle than in her recent work but it's there and delivered in that uniquely"}, {"Review": "LIVE on AMAZON for Only .99 cents Limited Time!!!!"}, {"Review": "My Thoughts on Five of Cups Trisha Wolfe once again brings readers a great book, this one centered around tarot cards. I loved it. I absolutely loved it.Dr. Ian West was the kind of smart that's sexy. He makes me wonder if other trial consultant books could be this good. I liked him and Porter as a couple. I loved their connection and shared history and the way things developed between them. But Ian himself is what really did it for me with this story. I don't even really feel like I can properl"}, {"Review": "Received ARC from AuthorI Give this Book a 3 Star RatingHeat Level: 3ishAs soon as I started reading I was instantly drawn in, especially to the eerily dark poetic beginning of the Prologue.The deeper I got into this story I gotta say I had no idea what was going to happen, couldn\u2019t even predict and I mean that in a great way, the story just kept my attention .West is a very likable guy and enjoyed his POV, and very reasonable.I\u2019m not really a fan of Porter, I personally just didn\u2019t find her ver"}, {"Review": "Is your cup half full? Or half empty?I absolutely loved this book and fell in love with Ian and Porter. Both characters are very realistic and relatable. Poter with her sacrifices. Ian with his sarcasm. Both broken in their own way and finding their own ways to deal with everything that has happened. One thing I have come to love about Trisha's writing is the realism and the twists. She takes us to a place that feels tangible. A courtroom, in this case, that feels like we are a part of the whole"}, {"Review": "So far I\u2019ve read a handful of the Cards of Love series, and I won\u2019t lie to you, Five of Cups is THE BEST!!The way Trisha writes is mesmerising. She somehow manages to throw so much information, filled with witty one liners and too many twists and turns to count, all into one book! I\u2019m a huge fan of law and order type books and Trisha manages to go into great detail regarding West\u2019 job, his team, even into his mind.

If I\u2019m honest I struggled a bit with this book but only due to that this book took more thinking on my part. I generally read books which are light and easy. I found myself having to take more breaks during reading...which I never do. However the storyline was amazing! The characters were interesting, often blunt, sometimes witty and I was intrigued! A courtroom consultant using his psychological knowledge to help the prosecution nail a murderer!

The man is psychologist and expert jury/trial consultant Dr. Ian West. This story in the Cards of Love series of unconnected stories, concentrates on a trial of a alleged killer who is drug lord, cocky and confident that he will be aquitted. He is manipulative and controlling, he thinks he will win. Dr. West is also very intelligent and confident, but he believes the jury will be"}, {"Review": "Couldn't put it down!

Team that with murder and romance and I\u2019m all in! Once I started reading The Five of Cups I couldn\u2019t put it down. A clever storyline, with so many twists and turns, had me hanging off the edge of my seat.

This has been my favorite book in this cards of love anthology-it\u2019s so intricate, and really grabbed me by every cell I had and immersed me into a world I wanted to quickly crawl out of-simply because I was scared.

This book is more a who done it type mystery / thriller twist type of a book. West is a very likable guy and enjoyed his POV, and very reasonable. In this book, it is a courtroom setting, which feels like we are a part of the whole process. A behind the scenes peek into the happenings. The fact that this is all West's POV is also something that I find adventurous, we get all the feels from him, the who's and"}, {"Review": "Intense!Dr. West, at first look, may seem a bit arrogant even a little cocky - as one of the top trial consultants he has earned that right.

Maybe a little Criminal Minds as well. She doesn\u2019t weave this big elaborate love story and let that be it. The author provides you with a story that flows. She provides you with a story that makes you engrossed with the characters and the who done it. With that said, I had a love/hate relationship with Porter. Her character was funny and smart but I felt like her character wasn\u2019t fully needed. I feel like most of th"}, {"Review": "What fate does the cards hold for you?
