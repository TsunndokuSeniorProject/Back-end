There is a gothic Victorian book placed inside the main story.\u00a0ooh...book inside a book. 2. Several points of view. 3. The mixture of modern and old school. 4. Police procedural mixed with the creepiness of the setting. 5. A quirky female detective with a sharp eye for inconsistencies. (She was my fave) 6. The setting of a \"haunted\" school.If your craving something a little different from you"}, {"Review": "Heavy draperied rooms, long winding staircases, and imposing carved wooden doors lend themselves to a Victorian Gothic panoramic view.

There's an array of buildings that stretch across the campus including the Old Building that houses the original effects of the writer, R.M. Holland.

I had tried Elly Griffiths popular Ruth Galloway series, and stalled with it. However, I am glad that I gave this a try, as I absolutely loved it and it has made me determined to go back and give Ruth Galloway another try.This is a clever, literary mystery, with an excellent cast of characters.

Whew.If you think that opening line was a lot to absorb, just wait until you read the book. I\u2019m still trying to untangle my mind from the who\u2019s and who\u2019s nots and what\u2019s real and what\u2019s not!

A mystery/thriller, this book centers around main characters Clare (a divorced English teacher who specializes in RM Holland), Georgie (her 15 year old daughter), and Harbinder Kaur (a detective). Most of this thriller centers around the school Talgarth High-this is where the famous Victorian writer RM Holland wrote and lived. An interesting character, Clare spends some of her free time researching aspects of his life for a book she is writing.

I was not disappointed. It\u2019s a treat! The Stranger Diaries is a perfect concoction of interesting characters, suspense, and thrills with a bit of spookiness thrown in.

She's later told a handwritten note was found next to Ella's body: a phrase from The Tempest, 'hell is empty'.

I feel bad for not even getting 25% through as this was an ARC but I just can't bring myself to carry on."}, {"Review": "Two books for the price of one.Elly Griffiths has a new crime mystery that has no direct link with her two established series. One of the things it does have in common is that it is very good. Full of her delightful humour and investable characters but for her as an author a bold venture as lacking the security of the familiar. It strays into uncharted territory moreover as there is a cap doffed to gothic horror and ghostly terror.Interspersed with the modern day fiction is the frightening tale"}, {"Review": "The Norfolk settings first drew me to Elly Griffiths\u2019 Ruth Galloway series - Kings Lynn is one of my very favourite English towns. But after several outings I\u2019d begun to find Ruth annoying. The Zig-Zag Girl featured a fascinating period - the 1950s - but stage magic and Brighton don\u2019t appeal to me. Yet I had very high expectations for The Stranger Diaries and I expect that I\u2019d been less disappointed had it not promised so much. Griffiths has created a ghost story, supposedly written by R.

The Stranger Diaries not only works as a homage to the work of R.M.

Cleverly worked and"}, {"Review": "DNF @ 27%This book had an interesting setup- divorced mother with childhood trauma moves into a murderous author\u2019s mansion. I really, really tried to like this; gothic fiction is my favorite genre, after all.I ended up hating the main character, Clare. She was insufferable with all her whining about her daughter not getting into the universities she wanted. She was the clich\u00e9 evil gothic matriarch, only the author tried to force the reader to sympathize with her. I hated the protagonist so much"}, {"Review": "If you enjoyed the way MAGPIE MURDERS combined a cozy country mystery with a modern one, THE STRANGER DIARIES does something similarly smart with gothic novels. It totally gets the gothic tradition to the point that I got actually creeped out a few times while reading it. While not quite a horror novel, it was really enjoyable. (The short story by the fictional Victorian writer in the book is A+, I loved all the bits of it scattered throughout the book.)This mystery walks a fine line between kee"}, {"Review": "I read this on the strength of Elly Griffiths' name as I love her Ruth Galloway series: this book is entertaining enough but doesn't show off Griffiths' strengths i.e. her ability to create quirky characters like Ruth, Harry, Cathbart etc., and there are only occasional gestures towards her trademark comedy/satire bon mots - in fact, the only time Clare raises interest is when she articulates something Ruth would say.The story itself is a modern Gothic-y serial killer with one of those dubious a"}, {"Review": "Elly Griffiths can do no wrong in my eyes and this fantastic stand alone Gothically atmospheric mystery is every bit as brilliant as I knew it would be.

Therefore I was beyond excited to learn that she had written a new, stand-alone novel.\u201cStranger Diaries\u201d has three distinct narrators and I was engaged with all three.

So states a character less than half way through The Stranger Diaries. The irony being that the reader has already worked out who the murderer is, and there's over half the book to go.
