The victim had been threatened by a well-known, award winning and fiercely literary writer and his husband seems to be hiding things\u2026 Of course, there are also issues from the past that bubbles up in surface of the case. Who visited the victim before he died, and why is there a number on the crime scene? This was such a fun read, and"}, {"Review": "Hawthorne is back with his rather abrasive personality and his undoubted skill at finding clues and solving cases. Horowitz features again as himself acting as Hawthorne's sidekick attempting to solve not one but possibly two murders.Having the author actively involved in his own book makes for some interesting reading. Occasionally I sat back and wondered which bits were fact and which fiction, but in the end it really does not matter. The book is totally enjoyable and very easy to read. There"}, {"Review": "This is the 2nd novel in the Daniel Hawthorne, Private Investigator series by Anthony Horowitz.I have not read the 1st book 'The Word is Murder' nor in fact any other books by this author but quickly realised once I started this novel that times were going to change. I was so impressed and enjoyed reading this book that I had already purchased a couple of the authors other books before finishing it.For me the book had a feel of an older style of detective novel, maybe an Agatha Christie or more"}, {"Review": "Another witty crime book from Horowitz. If you liked The Word Is Murder, you will enjoy this one too. I thought it was better than the first, the case being more cohesive.There were convenient coincidences after all, but still an enjoyable read. "}, {"Review": "Anthony Horowitz never disappoints!Richard Pryce, a high profile divorce attorney, is murdered in his home, bludgeoned to death with a two thousand quid bottle of wine, which is strange in itself as the victim didn\u2019t drink alcohol. Even stranger, written on the wall near the body are the numerals 182. What does the message mean? Hawthorne and Horowitz are called to investigate. As per usual I was hooked from the onset, and couldn\u2019t put the book down. Interesting and engaging characters, a suspec"}, {"Review": "4.5 stars Once again (again), Horowitz does not disappoint. I can honestly say that I will read whatever this man writes because he has a way of writing that is so hard not to love. It\u2019s impossible. Both Horowitz and Hawthorne are in this novel, and I just want to say that their partnership is a very weird one. I wouldn\u2019t call them friends, but they aren\u2019t so much acquaintances? It\u2019s so hard to describe what they are but that\u2019s the fun think about their partnership. In this novel, we are introdu"}, {"Review": "The Sentence is Death, the second novel to feature ex-policeman and Private Investigator Daniel Hawthorne, has an old-school, authentic atmosphere to it much like the crime classics of Agatha Christie and Arthur Conan Doyle. Horowitz focusses on mystery, suspense, intrigue and keeping it clean, rather than gratuitous violence or profanity, so if you like your reads clean, then this is a fantastic choice!Here, the author pairs up with Hawthorne to investigate the suspicious death of divorce lawye"}, {"Review": "3.5 stars rounded up.I very much enjoyed the first book and this one was also a good read. His style in this series is very chatty, like he is actually in the room telling you about his day. I\u2019m still confused about how much of this is true.. thanks to Netgalley for an arc of this book."}, {"Review": "I adored, \u201cThe Word is Murder,\u201d the first in the Daniel Hawthorne series, and was delighted to receive the second, \u201cThe Silence is Death,\u201d for review. As before, Anthony Horowitz, or \u2018Tony,\u2019 as Hawthorne calls him, is very much telling the story as himself. Horowitz is working on a television series when the book begins, and Hawthorne\u2019s reappearance is cleverly introduced \u2013 his arrival causing unintentional mayhem and annoyance. As before, Hawthorne is wonderfully irritating and yet has a bizarr"}, {"Review": " I've not read THE WORD IS MURDER, book one in this series, but I definitely want to after reading this one! To be honest didn't I know a damn thing about the story before I started to read/listen to this book (yes I tend to mix it when I have the chance, listen at work, read and listen at home). And to find that Anthony Horowitz has written two books with himself as a character was a great joy (such a fun idea). He's like Private Investigator Daniel Hawthorne's own Watson. Although, their worki"}, {"Review": "This is the second book in this series and I am really enjoying it. Love that the author narrates it and is a character in the books.

That\u2019s exactly right, the author of this novel is also acting as a main character, following the PI around in order to write a book (this book) about him. This infusion of some veritable facts mixed with fiction made it quite an except"}, {"Review": "Book reviews on www.snazzybooks.com The Sentence is Death is another brilliant novel from one of my favourite authors, Anthony Horowitz. I particularly enjoy this series as it's definitely different from most other 'crime' novels; I love the self-aware style of writing. Anthony Horowitz writes as himself, having been employed to write three books about ex-Detective Hawthorne. This is the second - the first one being The Word is Murder, another great novel [read my review here] - and throughout A"}, {"Review": "For my full review click on the link below:https://crossexaminingcrime.wordpress..."}, {"Review": "Private Investigator Daniel Hawthorne returns in the sequel to The Word Is Murder. Once again he teams up with sidekick Anthony Horowitz (the author himself) and once again they are on the trail of a murderer.As with their previous adventure there is plenty of humour, most of it at the author's expense! I love the eloquent plotting & the nice mixture of what I feel must be the \"real\" Anthony Horowitz & the \"fictional\" one. However, what I like most is that this novel is quite simply Fun"}, {"Review": "I like Anthony Horowitz books and this one was pretty different to the others I've read. Basically it's more of a slow-burn mystery. More of an Agatha Christie or Sherlock, old-style detective story.The core mystery seems to be based on a true story, though it was difficult to understand whether the elements (letters, historical articles etc.) which were added in to the story, were actually 'real' or part of the fictional book (I found this lack of clarity annoying, though perhaps it was my lack"}, {"Review": "Immensely enjoyable and very clever crime thriller in which the author plays a most unusual role. Every bit as good as The Word Is Murder. Roll on book 3. Review to follow shortly on For Winter Nights."}, {"Review": "Horowitz has kept the promise he created in his first book in this series, alive and well in the second one. My only sadness is that I have no more Daniel Hawthorne to read at the moment and must wait for 'Tony' to write some more.The way he mixes up reality and fiction has me with my finger on my kindle and another on my search engine checking things out. Me, another Sherlock in the making.Now to the story. Horowitz gives the clues then he does his utmost to confuse you and make you forget them"}, {"Review": "My first five-star-book in 2019 and I absolutely loved it!The story is gripping, I had no clue who the murderer was throughout the book but in the end it all made perfect sense, just how a good detective story should be! I don't know why but I just love the way Anthony Horowitz tells a story."}, {"Review": "Visit the London locations in the novelI remember the feeling I had when I read the first of the novels where Anthony H appears as a character in his own novel. Wow I thought, did that just happen? Well it did and this is a second one just as good as the first with a twisty tale of intrigue.It's a fascinating angle for a book as Horowitz writes of his issues of waiting around on film sets, how writers might be on a film set . As the book opens he is - on the set of Foyle's war no less when Micha"}, {"Review": "I wanted to like this more than I actually did as I think Mr Horowitz is a fine author. Sadly this felt like a rehash of the previous book in the series. Having said that, if you'd come to this book cold and read it as a standalone, it would be perfectly fine so perhaps I'm being overly critical.The whole DI Grunshaw subplot, however, was unnecessary and a bit ridiculous."}, {"Review": "If you\u2019ve not read The Word is Murder yet then I highly recommend you do so before starting this book. The narrative is so unexpectedly crafted that I don\u2019t think you could just jump into book 2 of this series without reading the first book to feature Hawthorne, a unique detective who could give Sherlock Holmes a good run for his money any day of the week!Once again a baffling murder case means the police call in Private Investigator Daniel Hawthorne and he takes along his partner in crime, the"}, {"Review": "A captivating whodunnitThis is the latest and second in the Daniel Hawthorne series. I haven\u2019t read the first but this in no way detracted from my enjoyment of this novel. Hawthorne has been brought in to investigate the murder of Richard Pryce, a high profile (and expensive) divorce lawyer whose throat has been slashed by a broken bottle of very expensive wine. His capacity in investigating the crime is a little vague, but it is crystal clear that there is no love lost between him and the senio"}, {"Review": "This is the second book in Horowitz\u2019s Hawthorne series. It\u2019s not absolutely necessary to read the first book, The Word Is Murder, before this one, but I would strongly recommend it. That\u2019s in part because this series has an unusual premise that\u2019s explained in more detail in the first book. The premise is that Anthony Horowitz, the author, is writing a fictional series in which Hawthorne is a sort of a downmarket Sherlock Holmes-ish genius, with Horowitz himself acting as Hawthorne\u2019s Watson.
