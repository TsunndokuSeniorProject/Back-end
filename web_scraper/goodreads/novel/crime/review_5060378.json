Swedish billionaires furnish their multi-million dollar apartments with IKEA --- well, at least ONE peculiar Swedish billionaire.[image error]Poang Chair $402. Asperger's Syndrome may give you the idea that a T-shirt that says \u2018I\u2019M AN ALIEN\u2019 is acceptable office wear, but also photographic memory and phenomenal mathematical ability.3. \"Sweden is one of the countries that imports the most prostitutes per capita from Russia and the Baltics\". Naughty Swedes.4. The best computer in the world is a Mac, but no matter what computer you have, Asphyxia WILL suck up all your digital secrets.5. You can live on Billy's Pan Pizza for days on end and STILL look like an anorexic teenager.6. All rapists and violent sex offenders should have these words tattooed on their stomachs: \"I AM A SADISTIC PIG, A PERVERT AND A RAPIST\". The tattoo should be done by an amateur and not be removable even by laser. Repeat offenders will be tattooed on their foreheads. It is recommended that the subject be tasered first before undergoing this involuntary procedure.7. \"There were not so many physical threats that could not be countered with a decent hammer\". Buy a good-sized one from the hardware store and keep it in your bag always.8. Failing that, a girl must always have the following ready:a. keys (to scratch an opponent's face);[image error]b. a can of mace, though it's illegal in Sweden; andc. a taser (a 50,000 volts jolt to the crotch will incapacitate even the burliest of men).9. \"Men could be as big as a house and made of granite, but they all had balls in the same place\". A crucial fact to remember in a fight, especially if you are fighting a 300 pounds, six foot six giant with hands as big as frying pans.POTENTIAL SPOILER 10.

The 40-year old mystery took a while to unfold, but was interesting when it did. So was Lisbeth, although she wasn't the main focus. Enter, The Girl Who Played With Fire. The story has now turned character-driven with Lisbeth as the protagonist. But instead of having much of a plot of any character revelations about her early on, we read about her buying a new apartment, grocery shopping, and what furniture she picked out at IKEA in *great* detail. Seriously, you could go down to the store and decorate the same way if you wanted, that's the level of description he gave. I was bored out of my mind. This goes on for a staggering 172 pages.Mystery thriller? Surely you jest! This book wasn't a mystery whatsoever for me. The fact that the police and everyone else working to solve the case chose to ignore it was pitiful.The turning point didn't happen until page 172, which was about 100 pages too late to hold the interest of any reader who's not a masochist. The quick pace and interest it generates rapidly disappears until 375.Really. It was more bloated than a rotting whale.The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo was a better book. I wanted to throw this one against the wall a few times."}, {"Review": "Stieg Larsson doesn't really do subtle. If he thinks an issue is important, he will shout it from the rooftops. With a megaphone. But since he is condemning misogyny and violence towards women, I'm ok with that.\n\"Salander was the woman who hated men who hate women.\" \nThis book, much more than its predecessor, focuses on the tiny-but-tough Lisbeth Salander. We learn quite a bit about the fascinating and horrific backstory that led to Salander developing her unique, defensive, prickly personality.\n\"Don\u2019t ever fight with Lisbeth Salander. Her attitude towards the rest of the world is that if someone threatens her with a gun, she\u2019ll get a bigger gun.\" But don't let the focus on Lisbeth fool you - essentially, this book should have been simply titled Men Who Hate Women, Part II (Men Who Hate Women was the original title of the first Swedish book, before it was changed to include a more marketable dragon tattoo) as its main theme remains the same as its predecessor's, repeated and restated countless times. And that's why I liked this otherwise far from perfect book.Yet again, Larsson determinedly exposes the unlikable aspects of society - misogyny and adherence to judgmental standards and gender norms that are ever-present even in the European paradise of Sweden. The surface mystery is just that - a plot device, an excuse to get a new angle on Larsson's favorite topic. We see the various shades and sides of hatred towards women, especially if they try to get out of the bounds that society neatly places for them. This is reflected first and foremost in the awful treatment that Salander receives, but also in the treatment of Lisbeth's mother, Sonia Bodig, and the helpless and easily ignored by the society victims of sex trafficking. \n\"When all the media assertions were put together, the police appeared to be hunting for a psychotic lesbian who had joined a cult of Satanists that propagandized for S&M sex and hated society in general and men in particular.\"\nI loved the no-compromise and no-subtlety message that this book delivers on the subjects that are indeed not subtle and should not be compromised on. However, I could not help but sigh and eyeroll at Larsson's less-than-perfect prose. His books could have really benefited from the generous use of editor's red pen. (But I do understand that these books were published posthumously and therefore probably not much was cut out out of respect to the dead author.) My gripes are similar to those of many other readers - the tediousness of every minute detail, the never-ending parade of brand names reading like an ad at times, and what feels like the entire Ikea catalog making a special appearance. This diary-like filler could have been easily cut out, leaving a much shorter and much sharper book. I also giggled at the author's self-insertion and clear wish-fulfillment in the memorable figure of incorruptible and irresistible journalist Blomkvist. And how can I forget a grating pet-peeve of not getting a medical condition right: (view spoiler)[A person who does not feel pain is destined for a rather disabled existence rather than becoming an indestructible superhero. Really. You can Google that (hide spoiler)].The final grade is 3 stars - full marks for the awesome message of the story, but points taken off for far-from-perfect execution.\n\"His attitude had always been that if a woman clearly indicated that she did not want anything more to do with him, he would go on his way. Not respecting such a message would in his eyes, show a lack of respect for her.\"\n"}, {"Review": "I am confident that Stieg Larsson has a reason for this, but Lisbeth Salander is not much of a heroine. Let's list her transgressions from The Girl Who Played With Fire (and these will be deliberately out of context):1. She forces herself on a 16 year old boy in Granada.2. She kills a man on the beach during a hurricane.3. She shuts out Blomkvist for a very long time for a perceived slight, giving him no explanation.4. She fails to take or show the necessary care with her ex-guardian after his stroke.5. She alienates everyone else who cares about her.6. She lives off billions that she stole.7. She invades the apartment of her \"guardian\" and threatens his life in the middle of the night.8. She endangers the lives of friends and innocents.9. She very nearly burned her father to death when she was a teenager.10. She pulls a gun on the owner of a car rental agency and shuts him in a broom closet to control him.11. She commits multiple computer violations, including the hacking of government computers.12. She carries and uses illegal weapons.13. She is genuinely ultraviolent.14. She shoots a man in the foot after macing his eyes, and she tasers another in the testicles.15. She steals a motorcycle.16. She chops her father's knee and skull with an axe.17. She is vengeful in a way that makes Edmond Dant\u00e8s look like a sissy.Let's face it, Lisbeth is more than a little bit nasty. And taken a step further, it is safe to say that she is not particularly likable. She is cold, calculating, emotionally irrational, mean, detached, abrasive, unapproachable, unfriendly, selfish, mercenary, vengeful, and more than a few other things most of us would classify as unlikable.Out of context, Lisbeth Salander is the kind of person who most people would be more than happy to see locked up forever. And if all we had to go on were the reports of newspapers and descriptions of trials, we'd all see it as a failure of the \"justice system\" if she went free.Yet we cheer for her in the Millenium Trilogy; we can't seem to help ourselves. And therein lies what Stieg Larsson is trying to tell us with his challenging protagonist -- context is everything.Larsson isn't simply writing a compelling series of thrillers (and I haven't been so locked into a book, as I was with GWPWF, for a very long time). He isn't simply fishing for a film deal. He isn't just sitting down to write a vapid bestseller. I'd even go so far as to say that Stieg Larsson is not a hack. Nowhere near. He is criticizing the very efficacy of what we so proudly call the \"rule of law.\"Larsson is suggesting that the \"rule of law\" fails because it has no room for context. It deals in absolutes (unless you're one of the super-rich or super-influential), and it doesn't give a damn whether you perceived a threat before you lit someone on fire; it doesn't care whether the sixteen year old you're having sex with is mature, in love with you and is totally willing; it doesn't care that you stole the car or killed someone to save a life; it doesn't care that you withheld evidence from the police to protect yourself or someone you love; it doesn't care that you hacked into computers for altruistic reasons; it doesn't care that you were bred to ultraviolence through nature and nurture; it doesn't care about you and it doesn't care about context. It just doesn't care, and because it doesn't care Larsson suggests that we should have a healthy disdain for the \"rule of law\" and recognize its terrible shortcomings because it is the structure we have to live with whether we like it or not.Yet with all this, The Girl Who Played With Fire is -- most importantly -- a cracking read. It is fast paced, cinematic in its noirishness, full of suspense, has a genuine twist or two (one of which actually took me by surprise), a cast of characters it is almost impossible not to love and hate (as the mood takes you) -- even thought they are all rather static -- and it ends with a cliff hanger of the first order (I am guessing this is a problem for some readers, but I am a fan of the cliff hanger).What a shame Stieg Larsson passed from us so soon. I could have read his books for the rest of my life. "}, {"Review": "Very short review due to the glitches on GR. This is the second book in the trilogy. I loved it and I loved the movie. The book bogs down a little but it's all good. Lisbeth is back and doing her own thing. Lisbeth has been away from Mikael for some time. But, they come back together when Lisbeth is accused of killing that jerk rapist of hers. *****Spoiler*****Lisbeth looks into a sex trafficking ring that Mikael is involved in and finds out some things about her past she didn't want to know. Her evil arse father is alive and she has a brother and they need to be taken out. But this almost gets her killed. Thank God Mikael was able to find her!"}, {"Review": "\nHe had come.He smelled of aftershave.She hated the smell of him.He...observed her for a long time.She hated his silence.Then he spoke to her. He had a dark, clear voice that stressed, pedantically, each word.She hated his voice.He laid the back of a moist hand on her forehead and ran his fingers along her hairline in a gesture that was probably intended to be friendly.She hated his touch.\n\nLisbeth Salander is simply unforgettable. \nI read the first book in this trilogy the year it was published in English and I remember the book so vividly that even five years later I transitioned into this book as if I\u2019d just finished reading Dragon last week. Salander is 4\u201911\u201d, but she walks across the literary landscape with such giant strides it is impossible to ignore her. People who have never read the books or seen the movies have a vague idea of who she is. People who have watched the movies or read the books may eventually forget her name decades from now, but they will not forget her persona; her verve; her courage.Now before we start feeling all warm and fuzzy about Salander there are few problems with knowing her. If you cross her she might throw a Molotov cocktail through your window. She is unreliable, unrelenting, and if you own a computer she will know everything about you. She is a hacker extraordinaire and even though she is extremely private, almost maniacal about her own personal information, she has no problem hacking into your personal affairs after all YOU should have been more careful with it. Despite her bristly exterior and her tendency to answer questions with a stare or a monosyllabic response you might find yourself attracted to her. She has a lesbian friend Mimmi who tries to explain Salander\u2019s relationship with sex. \u201dApart from the fact that you\u2019re not a dyke. You\u2019re probably bisexual. But most of all you\u2019re sexual--you like sex and you don\u2019t care about what gender, You\u2019re an entropic chaos factor.\u201dENTROPIC CHAOS FACTOR, sounds mathematical and math does play a role in this novel, but my version of what Mimmi meant by that statement is that Salander is a person who will parachute in out of the blue, shag you until your nucleus becomes a comet, and then leave before you\u2019ve had time to light your first coitus joint. \n\u201dA root of an equation is a number which substituted into the equation instead of an unknown convertsthe equation into an identity. The root is said to satisfythe equation. Solving an equation implies findingall of its roots. An equation that is always satisfied,no matter the choice of values for its unknowns,is called an identity.\u201dSalander solves complex math equations for relaxation purposes. Throughout the novel she is pursuing the answer to Fermat\u2019s last theorem. Now in the 1990s Andrew Wiles solved the problem using the world\u2019s most advanced computer programme which sounds like cheating to me. When she does figure out Fermat\u2019s intention it is the only time I can remember Stieg Larsson recording his literary heroine...giggling. Stieg Larsson is an interesting story. He delivered three novels to his publisher and shortly thereafter died from a heart attack, attributed to walking up seven flights of stairs. This unexpected demise helped launch the books onto the bestseller lists. We are morbid aren\u2019t we. He was an investigative reporter by trade and there was an inquiry into whether foul play was involved. It seems he was just a 50 year old man that fate placed a situation in front of him, an out of service elevator, that provided the proper strain to his heart to kill him. What endears these novels to me, even more, is that he wrote them in the evenings as an escape from regular life. Now, there are issues with these books, the use of name brands over and over. You will tire of hearing Powerbook, IKEA and Billy\u2019s Pan Pizza. If Larsson ate as many Billy\u2019s Pan Pizza as Salander does in the book that might be the doughy rope that squeezed his heart. \nBilly's Pan Pizza is YUMMY!!!Click the link to check out the Billy's Pan Pizza television commercial. It is a hoot.http://youtu.be/LZ9nUvg5yhkDespite any issues I had with the writing, and sometimes it was clunky, the raw power of the writing and a compelling plot made those issues irrelevant. Salander gets along just fine with the majority of the population, but she hates men who hate women. She ran into several of those in the first book and one in particular is seared into my memory, Nils Bjurman. He is the lawyer that has been assigned to her competency case. She was declared incompetent by the courts and assigned Bjurman to take care of her affairs. Salander is a confident person sometimes too confident and in book one she underestimates her ability to control a situation with Bjurman. He turns the tables on her and brutally raped her. With a presence of mind that is beyond most of the rest of us she recorded the rape and even as he is doing the most sadistic things to her she is going over and over in her head where she made the mistake and what she was going to do to him if he allowed her to live. Interesting enough she lets him live, but holds the video over his head like the sword of Damocles. \nBesides the video she does administer her own form of brutal vengeance, but there is a practicality to her decision not to kill him. The courts would simply assign her another mentor that she doesn\u2019t have control of and of course she would have to weather an investigation into his murder. In this book she makes a similar mistake in her pursuit for the man responsible for inspiring the rage and the violence that swirls around her.\nMikael Blomkvist is back and when his team of writers unearth a white slavery ring he finds himself battling a controversial issue that may impact the highest levels of society. Underage girls are being brought from Russia and forced into prostitution. It would be an easy assumption to make that every member of society would want to eliminate a situation that allows young girls to be exploited against their will. One of the problems is that men in government, in positions of power, enjoy the availability of such young, beautiful girls for their own sexual perversions. Despite the fact that Salander is not talking to Blomkvist, he is baffled as to why, she is drawn into the investigation because of the use of the name of one man... Zalachenko. As she becomes the main focus of the investigation she is forced to go underground, a skill she is particularly adept at, and as the rocket fueled plot comes to a conclusion this reader couldn\u2019t have put this book down even if the building was burning down around my ears because Salander... always... puts out a fire with gasoline. \nSee these tears so blueAn ageless heart that can never mendThese tears can never dryA judgement madecan never bendSee these eyes so greenI can stare for a thousand yearsJust be still with meYou wouldn't believe what I've been thruYou've been so longWell, it's been so longAnd I've been putting out firewith gasolineputting out fire with gasolineDavid Bowie\n"}, {"Review": "Flickan som lekte med elden = The Girl Who Played with Fire (Millennium, #2), Stieg Larsson The Girl Who Played with Fire (Swedish: Flickan som lekte med elden) is the second novel in the best-selling Millennium series by Swedish writer Stieg Larsson.

The action sequences, the constant tension continually building up to lead to a tremendous ending. Lisbeth freaking Salander, she may actually be one of the best, and most complex characters I've ever had the pleasure of reading about. Introverted, extremely genial, and dangerous if need be, she's the epitome of the formula to the creation of a super-intriguing character.Like the first book, this was a complete investigation-kind-of-book. But unlike the first one, this has nothing to do with third parties, and everything to do with Lisbeth. It's a more personal book, and it cements the core of this series, which is Lisbeth. There are lots of new information about Lisbeth, and she becomes somewhat less enigmatic as we begin to get a glimpse at the troublesome, dark past. Sex trafficking, Russian hitman, murders. What else does a book need to be freaking thrilling? Salander in this book becomes obsessed with math, she takes it up as a hobby, and up until the last moments when her life is hanging by a thread, she finds the solution to a mathematical problem. Such a peculiar protagonist, I feel constantly intrigued by her and I always have to expect the unexpected from her.Up until half of the book, nothing extraordinary really happens, it's just plot building up but there's lots of Salander, so it's interesting and gripping to read. Then, at about halfway into the book everything changes. A police hunt begins. You'll have to guess who the hunted is. And how the hell they ended up into this mess.Surprisingly, there's less Blomkvist in this than the first book. Although, he's still a prime character to the story, he takes the role of the secondary character rather than the first one, as we saw him in the first book. In the entirety of the book, Blomkvist and Salander hardly ever meet. So, summing everything up, I'll admit that I liked this better than the first because of the more personal storyline the author followed. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS!!"}, {"Review": "\n\nBook Review\n\n4 of 5 stars to The Girl Who Played with Fire, the second book in the Millenium thriller series written in 2006 by Stieg Larsson. Although I am very fond of this book, it wasn't quite as good as the first one, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. But it's a very strong follow-up sequel worth reading. It packs an even larger punch as far as violence and drama, as well as brings out the sexual chemistry and tension between Mikhail and Lisbeth. But this book is all about Lisbeth... and in a strange way, I root for her. Despite the crazy that comes with her, she's been through the ringer more than once. And when she gets revenge on those who harmed her in the past, I was a big fan of her tactics... despite what that may say about me. What's great about these books is the intensity they bring to the entire story. \n\nAbout Me\n\nFor those new to me or my reviews... here's the scoop: I read A LOT. I write A LOT.

Can Mikael Blomkvist clear her name before the police find her? And what does Lisbeth's situation have to do with an expose of the Swedish sex trade two of the murder victims were working on?I was afraid The Girl Who Played With Fire would suffer from the sophomore jinx. I'm pleased to say it did not.Larsson must have figured out he had a good thing in Lisbeth Salander while working on The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo because she's the primary focus of this, the sequel. Actually, it's not all that much like its predecessor. TGWTDT was a mystery and TGWPWF is a faster paced thriller.The structure of the two books is fairly similar: a slow build up to a lightning storm. Honestly, I can't figure out why these books work so well for me. They both begin slow and have a lot of extraneous details I think might have been pruned had Larsson been alive when they were accepted by a publisher, notably the oddly specific minutae of the characters' everyday life and the prominence of brand names. Still, once I started reading them, they kind of took over my life for a few days.The Girl Who Played With Fire is, in a way, an exploration of Lisbeth Salander's past. Where The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo barely scratched the surface, this book did some strip-mining. Since the villains were players in the sex trade, they were not sympathetic and quite vile. The action was even more brutal than in the previous book and there was a lot more of it. Without giving too much away, Lisbeth Salander is so tough there should be an internet meme dedicated to how much of a bad ass she is. \"If Chuck Norris had a sex change and gained 50% more damage-inflicting skills, he would be Lisbeth Salander\" or something to that effect.I felt that the parts of the story about Lisbeth eclipsed the other parts of the story by a wide margin, a good thing in my book. I wasn't that interested in the everyday business of running Millennium or who was falling for Mikael \"The Ladies Man\" Blomkvist anyway.I guess I should bring this review to a thrilling conclusion before I start giving away plot points. I enjoyed The Girl Who Played With Fire even more than I did the previous volume. Five easy stars."}, {"Review": "4.75/5 stars. This sequel to \"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\" is brilliant! This is some of the best crime fiction that exists, in my opinion, and Lisbeth Salander remains one of my favourite fictional characters of all time. The plot of this novel is clever and the diverse set of characters fascinating. The only reason why this novel is not just as good as the first one, is because it contains some passages that at times seemed dwelling and somewhat repetitive. That being said, the conclusion makes up for it and also contains one of my favourite fictional scenes. Read this, also even though you're not that much into crime fiction, like me ;)"}, {"Review": "Much later. After such insistence on preserving my idea of my father, my memory of our last meeting, this happened a couple of Fridays ago. I opened up some photos taken by my brother and there my father is, dead in his coffin. I must confess to being quite distressed. And I still don't understand why on earth is this something to preserve? I don't get it one little bit.----------------Hooked. Totally, completely, utterly hooked. I read this book yesterday during lunch even though I was with two perfectly nice interesting people. And then today. Today we cremated my father without any ceremony, but first there was what they call a \u2018viewing\u2019. I so didn\u2019t want to do that and still have absolutely no comprehension whatsoever as to why one would want to look at a dead body. So while the others did their dead body thing I sat in the lounge area with my nose buried in Stieg. And, although, it would not be true in the least to say I didn\u2019t go next door to look at my dead father because I couldn\u2019t put the book down, the fact is that people kept coming in to talk to me, like\u2026I don\u2019t know exactly\u2026.but maybe like they thought that this would create some link between me and whatever was happening next door, like maybe they were worried I\u2019d feel left out and what I wanted to say to them was \u2018Can\u2019t you see I\u2019m reading?\u2019 \u2018If I miss you all, honestly, I\u2019ll drop by next door, I will, really.\u2019 I didn\u2019t, doubtless you will be relieved to hear. Instead I chatted amiably to whoever wanted to interrupt me. But. I so wanted to say \u2018go away\u2019. And there I find myself having to put my book down for a bit to talk to my aunt, thinking why do I have to do this, my aunt probably doesn\u2019t even like me. My mother has two sisters, one\u2019s a nun, and hence she\u2019s an absolute trooper, but the other one seems a little fragile to me in some way that I can\u2019t connect to. And I know it is all my dead father\u2019s fault. I almost went next door to remind him of that. It was like this. We\u2019d been separated for many years from both sides of my family, but as a grownup I did start seeing just these two sisters again now and then. The first time my aunt Rosemary was with a bunch of nuns including my other aunt. Paul introduced me to them \u2018This is Cathy, my eldest, she is a divorcee who plays cards for her living.\u2019 All true, if you want to put it like that. My father said it with great relish and satisfaction, I might add. Not with a long mournful face, shaking his head. Not like, what am I doing to do with her? More like he\u2019d just bought a red car and didn\u2019t everybody know they go faster? He loved shocking people. But I do think the only person who might have been the least bit shocked is Rosemary. And ever since when I see her, I feel like she looks at me in some slightly dubious way. Like I\u2019m a riverboat gambler. Or a scarlet woman; that it follows in some way from being a divorcee who gambles that one is a certain colour as well.And the thing about scarlet is that it is one of those colours that is bigger than others. I was wearing a black party dress today with just the tiniest bit of scarlet on it, but it feels like more. It\u2019s a colour that stands out. In the literal definition of the word I\u2019ve never been a scarlet woman, but I have certainly done things for money in my life that don\u2019t feel much different. There too, it\u2019s a bit like the dress. A little bit of scarlet goes a long, long way.There is a most earnest statistical analysis of this book that will come later on the weekend when I\u2019ve finished. It\u2019s about breasts and punctuation and honestly, it will be a serious, weighty contribution to the understanding and critical analysis of this book. Update. To keep you interested while I'm still preparing my groundbreaking statistical analysis.Oh. Reading Paul\u2019s comment I\u2019m thinking okay, I need to put a bit more about this book here. So.I happened to recall, earlier today, a conversation I had twenty years ago when I was living in Sydney. The phone rang and it was an acquaintance, John. A bit of chitchat and he says \u2018Remember you said how much you were into mangoes.\u2019 DidI? I was slightly taken aback. \u2018Yeah, yeah. Last time I saw you, you were talking about them.\u2019 I cast my mind back. It was a Victory Dinner after a bridge tournament. We\u2019d snuck outside and shared a few joints between courses. But what on earth would have made me say that? Was I so wasted? \u2018Well, John, I\u2019ve never been averse to a nice mango\u2026\u2019. He was really being quite intense about the whole thing, \u2018I wondered if you wanted me to send you some. Send you some mangoes\u2019. This was really getting a bit silly. For heaven's sake, I lived in Sydney. I merely had to put my hand into the outside air and a mango might fall into it. And suddenly the penny dropped. He wasn\u2019t talking about mangoes. He was talking about Northern Territory\u2019s finest. He was asking me if I wanted him to send me some dope. Of course! He just didn\u2019t want to say, on the telephone. I was with it. \u2018Oh, Mangoes\u2026sorry John. You\u2019re right, I do still love mangoes. Great idea, please do send me some.\u2019Later that night I told Michael about the whole exchange. He was in complete agreement, clearly John was sending us dope. We are expert bridge players, after all. Like we can\u2019t analyse a situation like this. Like it wouldn\u2019t be obvious in a Stieg Larsson book, what we were really talking about.A week later a box of mangoes turned up. Michael, with the desperate conviction of a drug addict, took the box apart and then each mango, still sure he was right. Me, I figured straight away, we weren\u2019t in a crime thriller after all. -------------------------------------------------------The last word on this book.Okay. I\u2019ve, um, read the book now, so here goes. A book review. After a bit of an argument early on with somebody who had read this, I decided to keep some stats. But just as I figured this book was all about the new, busty Salander and the story line was going to be dominated by people sucking on silicon, (people, sic; dykes, yawn), she disappears from the story altogether! What a device. What a piece of creative trickery by the Stieg. What a way to skew my statistics.You will find her tits on pages: 15/1627/8758592103-4106-8and then \u2013 well, she\u2019s scarcely in the story for the next few hundred pages. So, although I began the story positively indignant that the superhero had a self-esteem problem that could be resolved by a bit of body mutilation, after a while the whole issue vanished along with the rest of her. I simply don\u2019t understand why Salander would behave in such a tediously average way. I was ready to be really disappointed with this direction (pp. 106-8 is when her friend Wu points out to her that she is hung up about, and obsessed by, her body) but I\u2019d forgotten it soon enough. In fact I wondered if the Stieg got rid of her just so as he didn\u2019t have to find anything more to do with these new possessions of hers.Setting aside the whole pretend breasts thing, do I have to say anything else about the book? It\u2019s fun, un-put-downable, just like the first one. A dissertation it does not require.I was disappointed with the chess, p. 143 which is badly done. Although this doesn\u2019t matter in a sense, because none of us know enough to care, if you extrapolate from that, you get to the book itself. If you happen to be in the general field of murder mystery conspiracy, journalistic exposes, police-procedurals etc and think this book is badly done, does that mean it\u2019s badly done? If we all don\u2019t know and don\u2019t care, then it isn\u2019t badly done, is that right? It\u2019s believable because it\u2019s believable. This is just a hypothetical, nothing in particular to do with the book itself. I hope somebody understands what I\u2019m saying here because I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m with the plot\u2026even though it\u2019s mine. Maybe this is a better way of putting it. If somebody with a modicum of chess knowledge says the chess is badly done we don't care for obvious reasons. But if a crazed killer said to you 'Nup, sorry, that is just so unbelievable the way...This book is just so not like it is.', wouldn't we care then? Yes? No?On the usage of the comma in relationship to \u2018and\u2019, a source of some discussion recently as I'm confused by how often it is used and why.p.270 We have the sentence \u2018But we do have to stay on top of what the police uncover and worm out of them what they know.\u2019 I had to read that a couple of times before I understood it meant: \u2018But we do have to stay on top of what the police uncover, and worm out of them what they know.\u2019 I thought it meant that the police were uncovering and worming, though of course that sentence doesn\u2019t make sense.Then, what about these:p. 231 \u2018They had heard no sound from the apartment, and nobody had answered the bell. They returned to their car and parked where they could keep watch on the door.\u2019Why? Why a comma before the \u2018and\u2019 in the first of these back-to-back sentences? And if so, then why not in the second?------------------------------------------------------------------"}, {"Review": "\u201cThere are no innocents. There are, however, different degrees of responsibility.\u201dWow. Stieg Larsson did it again. He took my breath away.Larsson's style of writing is unique. It is so very detailed and everything seems to be perfectly planned.The characters are diverse and interesting and I am not only talking about Lisbeth Salander, the novel's heroine, but about most side characters as well.This novel is full of nerve-wracking suspense and thrill, especially the beginning and the middle.However, I wanted the novel to end faster. For my taste the finale didn't have to be a hundred pages long.Still, The Girl Who Played with Fire is a more than worthy sequel to The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo."}, {"Review": "Unfortunately not as good as M\u00e4n som Hatar Kvinnor. He has gone too far, and Lisbeth Salander is no longer a fully credible person; also, the puzzle isn't as satisfying as in the first one.Start geek-rant: as a former mathematician, I was annoyed by his sloppiness concerning Fermat's Last Theorem. To start off with, he misquotes it several times. And the whole idea that Lisbeth is able to solve it on her own in just a few months, with no formal mathematical training, is cheap. If this were the only thing wrong, it wouldn't of course matter very much. But it's more a symptom of the lack of care he is displaying... the whole book has an unfinished feel to it. But, before I get too critical, I must admit that I couldn't put it down, and that the main characters, especially Lisbeth, are wonderful creations. I'm sure I'll read the third volume soon."}, {"Review": "This is the sequel to The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo and it was immediately as good as the first but this time I knew this from the very first page.The first one I felt was slightly more clumsy at the beginning and took a while to truly love it. I speak only for myself of course. This one it starts off with a bang and you know immediately from the first page it is going to be just as good if not better.Blomkvist takes a back seat here and Salander takes the lead. She after all is really the most interesting character. It is slightly coincidental how Blomkvist is involved with the storyline but not so much it is a gaping hole in the plot at all.Once again the book is full of excitement and twists and turns. It has a steadily fast pace that never stops. One minute you're thinking it is going one way and then it just goes another. It never stop moving.I'd say it has a different tempo then the first one. It is much better paced I think from start to finish. The characters are already established for one thing.It is an entirely different story from the first one. However, Larsson still continues to highlight inadequacies in the government and system. So many characters are corrupt or just downright awful, people. Most of them are men. Larsson seems to have gone to war against the male race yet again. He still goes on his mini-rants but they're not quite so prominent as last time and fit much more into the story.I enjoy the straight forward style of writing - obviously this is through a translation of Swedish to English, but it feels different to other things I have read. Again, as with the first it feels very much as if Larsson has put his life and soul into writing these books and you can feel that emanating from the pages. I loved this just as much as the first - and he left it just at a point when you NEED to read more but it isn't a drastic cliff hanger but I am now eagerly and very impatiently waiting for the next book."}, {"Review": "If loving the Millennium books is wrong, baby, I don't want to be right.In scanning through the other reviews, I have to concur with many of the problems mentioned: superfluous detail (specific IKEA furniture is mentioned several times--as if I know what any of it looks like just because I have the model number provided, sandwiches are made, coffee is brewed, Billy's Pan Pizzas are consumed); there's a real dearth of poetic or stylized language; there's a cast of hundreds (maybe not quite, but it can certainly feel like it); people whose physical injuries should kill them miraculously survive; there's suspense build-up that has all the subtlety of dramatic chipmunk http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1Y73s.... And you know what? Don't care. Don't give a shit. Because all I ask of genre literature is that it tell a helluva good story and Larsson, for all of his sins against the church of high literature, can tell a helluva story. Because a book like this relies so much on plot, here's the basic summary without any spoilers: Lisbeth Salander returns to Sweden after months of living abroad on the billions she stole from Wennerstrom; Mikael Blomkvist is now a media celebrity, though he continues to doggedly search for Salander; Millennium plans to publish a book on the Swedish sex trade (and they plan to name names of police officers and politicians who are involved, as well as bring charges against them upon the date of publication); both Salander and the author of the book become obsessed (for very different reasons) with finding a man named Zala; IKEA's 2010 spring catalog is described in detail; Salander is accused of a double murder and has to go into hiding; Blomkvist doggedly attempts to prove an uncooperative Salander innocent. Of course all of these plot threads, as well as many others, are brought together in the end.What makes this novel really work is the character of Lisbeth Salander. In The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, Salander is established as a bad ass you do not want to tangle with. In the movies, we have become accustomed to our female action characters as being towering Amazons with pouty lips, glamorous wardrobes, and double D's spilling out of Victoria's Secret push-up bras. The irony of strong women in film (and many books) is that they have to be model beautiful and highly sexualized femme fatales that are desired by fanboys everywhere. And in Lisbeth Salander, Larsson has created the antithesis to all of that hyper-feminine-but-I'll-kick-your-ass-and-look-good-doing-it bullshit. Salander is not tall, she is not glamorous, she is not beautiful. She's described by others as looking like a rag doll or a teenage boy. She's the last person you would expect to hand you your ass on a silver platter. But if you cross her, you can expect things in your life to go very wrong very quickly.The other genius thing Larsson has done with Salander in this novel is that she's beginning to evolve. Using her unexpected wealth, Salander has traveled the world and learned more about herself. She's begun to question her previous lifestyle and has realized that she has few true friends--and that it's her fault. Being anti-social and emotionally closed off has always been a defense mechanism for her, but it's beginning to dawn on her that the price she has paid for keeping her guard up may be too high. For the first time in her life, she has the opportunity to live a different life, but she's not quite sure how to go about it. There's an unexpectedly poignant scene in which Blomkvist looks around Salander's mansion-sized apartment and finds that she is only living out of 3 of the 21 rooms. He notes that, despite all of the new furniture, her home is soulless and completely devoid of mementos, photographs, or anything personal; it's as if she's uncertain how to make this a home and the loneliness of her life is evident. Despite this, she certainly hasn't lost her edge and she still lives a life of stringent moral standards, punishing her enemies without mercy and basically ignoring her friends. I also appreciate that Larsson does not set her up as someone who should be emulated (when Blomkvist blames Salander's mental state on her past, Holger Palmgren tells him, \"I hope you understand that there really is something wrong with Lisbeth . . . Her problems go way beyond problems she had at home\"). To me, Salander is a tragic figure. Sure she's MENSA-level intelligent, has a photographic memory, the ability to kick ass and take names, but who would want to be her? We also learn much more about her troubled background in this novel, which further explains some components of her behavior. As for the central mystery of the novel, I didn't find it as compelling as that of Tattoo and there's a twist at the ending worthy of a soap opera reveal, but I still enjoyed the ride enough that I've already ordered my copy of The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest.

third of \"The Girl Who Played with Fire.\" Lisbeth Salander is composing and arranging a new life for herself while still maintaining the baggage left over from her early years (tons of child abuse) and the occurrences of Book #1. And she's still acting, to put it nicely, quite unconventional. It is precisely this mask, as well as people's prejudices & judgements that make her the ideal infiltrator of conspiracies in the highest echelons of modern Swedish society.All the characters from the first make cameos (well, the ones who survived), & it is because of the magnifying glass on \"The Girl (with the Dragon Tattoo)\" & the slow introduction of our old pals that makes this a more enjoyable read. The focus of the book changes radically and Mikael Blomkist, the protagonist of Book 1 is more in the background this time. Lisbeth is totally more interesting than Mikael. & yet, I am not quite certain if it is enough.New \"thrillers\" tend to give you pages and pages you can devour but, really, in perhaps more elegant hands these tales may have touched the Gates of LITERATURE and less trees would have been used. This is a Hollywood flick with symbolism which adds much needed relevance to the genre--& all this is good. Also good--the anti-Macho sentiment and reversal of roles (in this case--the girl with Aperger's is smarter, more agile and even richer than most of the human population) which will be undoubtedly be scrutinized furthermore in the concluding installment. But I am starting to fear that, like a way (wayyyy) more respectable and smarter \"Twilight\" franchise (popularity-wise), the \"Millennial\" books may all turn out to be more noise and spectacle than substance."}, {"Review": "This book was pretty slow getting started, but when it did, it did it with stupendous style. Lisbeth Salander ran the show in this one, which I really loved. I liked Lisbeth in the first book, but in this one, we see more sides to her than ever before. Let me put this plainly, I want to slurp freshly brewed coffee and scoff Billy pan pizza's with this woman, even if she is a cold and calculated pain in the ass at times. What I especially liked about this book, was all the weird twists and turns. When I thought I'd definitely got a theory to what was actually going on, the author threw another major spanner in the works, and I was back to square one. You don't really find peace with the story, until the very end of the book, and at that point, I felt kind of deflated that I'd finished it. At this moment, I need more Lisbeth Salander!"}, {"Review": "Larsson's second novel about Lisbeth Salander, or about MIkhail Blomkvist of Millennium Magazine, either as it may be, was a suspenseful gem. A little slow to get started, this one lacked the steady momentum of the first, but the second half more than makes up for the inconsistent and morose first half. Larrson was immensely talented and it is a great shame that we can look forward to no more novels from him. As Blomkvist was the center of attention in the first, Salander is definitely the subject here and we get to know her story in great, journalistic depth. Flawed, but very good."}, {"Review": "\n\u201cNot him too.\u201d \u201cNot him too what?\u201d \u201cAnother admirer of Fr\u00f6ken Salander.\u201d\nWhy yes, I am too! Lisbeth has earned herself another admirer. Well, not completely but mostly.This was a BR with the Lisbeth Fanatic who promised me a mindfuck but unfortunately I didn\u2019t get that and then the said fanatic disappeared soon after we commenced the journey got busy reading! ;)Happy now? :PThis is a hard book to review without giving anything out and since I myself haven\u2019t read the last part, I can\u2019t say what might/might not tie in later into the final book. So I will strictly keep with the blurb and only talk about what I feel about the book.A good while has elapsed since the Vanger affair and life has moved on. Everyone\u2019s busy doing their own thing. Lisbeth Salander is on a year-long vacation, globe-trotting, to put some distance between the people and events. As if that\u2019s going to help. She\u2019s busy doing a little bit of everything. Focusing on her looks, spying on a random guy, sleeping with a minor, solving age old mathematical puzzles and even killing a guy while saving a women. Oh the middle part? That\u2019s right. She sleeps with a minor and although it is made out to be consensual, it just kinda rubs wrong. Oh well, as long as she\u2019s having fun.Meanwhile\u2026.Mikael \u2018Kalle\u2019 Blomkvist from Millenium has a penchant for doing expose\u2019s and taking on that which is socially acceptable. After the success of the last one that turned him into a celebrity of sorts, this time, collaborating with a young journalist, he is doing and expose and getting a book published on Sex Trafficking. Intent on taking on some powerful people and jolting the masses to tell them that there is something wrong with the system itself. \n\u201cSay hello to Blomkvist and tell him he\u2019s tempting fate.\u201d \u201cHe might like that.\u201d\n When he\u2019s not working, he can be found sleeping around with almost anyone and you wouldn\u2019t even be surprised. Creeped out? Sure. Surprised? Nope!Then\u2026.Lis comes back home and then begins the excruciatingly detailed account of her setting up a home for herself and the process of furnishing it. Quite frankly this part should\u2019ve been cut short. She keeps avoiding Blomkvist and all his attempts of getting in touch with her for years. \n\u201cShe had cut him out of her life as surgically and decisively as she deleted files from her computer, and without explanation.\u201d\n All the while Blomkvist keeps trying to get Lis to talk atleast once so as to understand what went wrong and why he has been carved out of her life so abruptly and harshly.All of a sudden\u2026.A young couple is murdered. On the murder weapon are fingerprints of\u2026.of course\u2026.Lisbeth! With her history and psyche profile, she\u2019s an obvious walking hazard that just went overboard. An open and shut case for the police authorities, as far as they are concerned. All of the media and authorities easily agree and declare Salander the culprit. \n\u201cLisbeth, Lisbeth, what the fuck have you got yourself mixed up in?\u201d\n All that\u2019s left is to bring her in. Only\u2026no one can find Lis. She seems to have disappeared and won\u2019t be found unless she wants to. But she can keep tabs on everyone and everything and she does. And ensues the game of cat and mouse and the reveal at the end is bound to leave your jaw on the floor.So\u2026this book is weird as shit! So was the last one. And I think no one will disagree with me. This book is all about Lis. Her character curve is most amazingly shaped. The background on her is very well done, on what turned her into the way she is. And the way she is, kickass she may be but she is as far from regular and normal as you can imagine. The writing is good and fluent. The book is definitely slow to pick up but once it starts rolling, it\u2019s a great ride. This series is mostly focused on crime and violence against women. For such a book you definitely need a badass, kickass and cocky little devil of a leading lady and who better than Lisbeth Salander! \n\u201cSalander was the woman who hated men who hate women.\u201d\n Although it wouldn\u2019t be wrong if I said that Lisbeth is fucking nasty. And if I am honest, it is safe to say that she is not very likable. Miss Salander is cold, calculating, mean, hopelessly detached, abrasive, unfriendly, selfish, vengeful, and bordering on psychopath. \u201cBut this dude just said he\u2019s a fan\u201d, that\u2019s what you\u2019re thinking, right?The point is, context matters. Not all seemly deplorable acts are truly deplorable but most are. Not all that Lis does is badass. Some of what she does is just hurtful and chaffing. But the \u2018why\u2019 of it matters. A person is a certain way because they were molded that way. And it\u2019s not for us to say whether they came up right or not. We weren\u2019t there. And yet\u2026we are here now. And there is nothing worse than not taking someone on their merit. Past shapes us up but it is not an indication of future. Someone came close and hurt you and broke your trust; doesn\u2019t mean everyone else will too. \n\u201cI don\u2019t know why I didn\u2019t say goodbye.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll tell you why: because you don\u2019t give a shit about other people,\u201d Armansky said matter-of-factly.Salander bit her lower lip. \u201cUsually it\u2019s other people who don\u2019t give a shit about me.\u201d\u201cBullshit,\u201d Armansky said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got an attitude problem and you treat people like dirt when they\u2019re trying to be your friends. It\u2019s that simple.\u201d \nWhen I was reading the first book and the good people of GR asked me how I felt about Lis, I told them she reminds me a little too much of a real life person I know and that can be a bad thing. But book one was fine and I ended up liking Lis quite a lot. But after reading this book, my fears have been realized. Lis does too many things that I am personally not okay with and thus my love for her has diminished. For me the highlight of this book was the bond between Blomkvist and Lisbeth. Rather how Blomkvist is bonded to Lis. How he treats her with respect and how he affords her his trust. When all the world is against her, he stands in her corner like a rock (even if remotely through a computer) and believes in her against all odds. When everyone has written her off, he didn\u2019t. \n\u201cBlomkvist felt as if someone were squeezing his heart. He felt that he had to find Salander and hold her close. She would probably bite him if he tried.\u201d\n Someone who believed in her despite her treating him like shit. Something I hate Lis for. Someone who cares for you, makes an effort for you even if it is in their own flawed ways, it should earn them respect and trust, atleast a small measure of it. I could turn this into a debate and a philosophical thing but where\u2019d be the point in that?On the whole, this book is a good follow up on the first one even though it is a bit of a letdown for me. It makes for a good fast paced read that will keep you biting your nails from time to time. The book ends on a cliffhanger and makes you want to pick the next installment right away. There are some major flaws in this book and its plot, especially the foolhardy approach of Lis at times, who has definitely done some major ass kicking in the book and it is good to learn more about her character and her motivations and yet, it doesn\u2019t justifying her being bitchy most of the times. But the moral of the story is \n\u201cDon\u2019t ever fight with Lisbeth Salander. Her attitude towards the rest of the world is that if someone threatens her with a gun, she\u2019ll get a bigger gun.\u201d\n"}, {"Review": "I struggled through this 514-page book.To begin with, all the homo, bi, double-partner, and heterosexual talk was a bit much. Way beyond my comfort level.To be fair, once I got about half-way through the book - after all the characters' sexual preferences were clearly established - it did become a page-turner as I raced to find out the ending.If you like books with lots of character sketches, this might work for you. I was tempted to get out a notepad and sketch out all the characters and their relationships, as I kept getting the Swedish characters' names mixed up.I have not read the prior book in this series: The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo. Perhaps having done so would have helped me in the first half of the book, though others have said you can read this as a stand alone book.No complaints about the writing style itself. I know this book is getting great reviews; I just didn't find anything in the book that I could personally relate to or particularly felt drawn to. The heroine Salander is as far from my personality as you can get, I think..."}, {"Review": "I LOVED THIS 2nd book by Larsson.

It comes out Oct. 1st."}, {"Review": "Culture imposes on women constant indoctrination of the idea that our vaginas should make us small, weak, and incapable of caring for ourselves or others.\"A woman could obviously never be a fire fighter, for example.\" \"We couldn't send a woman to do that military job because what if she got her period? She couldn't take a week off when she's there!\" \"There are just some days in the month when a woman diplomat wouldn't be able to do her job.\" \"I wouldn't watch women's sports because women aren't as strong as men, but I guess the clothes are hot.\" \"But, if we hire her, she'll probably want more time off because she has a kid, so she won't be able to do her job.\" \"Sure one 'woman' did that, but she isn't like real women, and she's probably a lesbian.\"It is easy to internalize that thinking, even though it obviously makes very little sense. Plenty of men are short and women are tall. Plenty of women are athletic and men sedentary. Gender has very little to do with physical strength, abilities, or athleticism. And, of course, plenty of men experience indoctrination that they are weak or lazy, and plenty of women, thankfully, live in families that undermine these stereotypes, so I'm not talking in specifics here. What I'm talking about is media and culture and the gendered expectations they impose as a sort of zeitgeist based in gender. That spirit is still that femininity is weak and masculinity is strong, and even where we see it making no sense, it is easier said than done to untangle right from wrong.This second installment of the adventures of Lisbeth Salander looks very academically at appearances in basically the same manner as Girl With the Dragon Tattoo analyzed consent. It has Lisbeth with dark hair and light, tattoos and implants. It sizes her, the smallest of small girls, up against the most giant of giant men. It is also clever, in the same academic way that GWTDT was with consent, in easing the reader into comparisons and becoming more extreme, developing the idea to its furthest, as the book goes on. The boxer takes on the giant; Lisbeth takes on the douchey biker: Larssen eases us into the comparison of sizes and appearances. And the idea is this: appearance and size do not dictate our successes and failures; they should not dictate who we are.I think the idea of Lisbeth getting implants early on in the book is interesting. The feel of the way it plays out with her seems . . . off, but I still can appreciate a sort of contrast between my instinctive reaction to Lisbeth altering her body with tattoos to my reaction to her altering her body with implants. On the one hand, I do think my aversion to the idea of implants is valid because of all of the women I\u2019ve known whose implants have become infected or calcified. It\u2019s just a bad health decision in most cases, in my opinion, in a way that I don\u2019t think tattoos are unhealthy as a rule. On the other hand, I can see how altering your own body, in any way, can be experimental and interesting and give a sense of ownership. So, to the extent I start to judge the choice to get implants as succumbing to an oppressive social idea of women\u2019s bodies, and getting tattoos as valid and empowering, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m being entirely fair. I am cool with a woman doing what she wants with her body, and judging a woman based on plastic surgery ultimately seems as dumb to me as judging her based on her tattoos.Still, it seems unlikely to me that a woman who had a bad day would run herself a Jacuzzi bath and sink to the bottom of it, pinching her nipples really hard, even if she had just gotten a boob job she was super excited about. That seemed weird. It also seemed weirdly simplistic to me to describe how pleased Lisbeth was with her implants and how they made her feel attractive. I don\u2019t dispute the idea that implants could make a woman feel attractive, but that seems like a shallow emotion to describe compared to other, underlying feelings that go along with it. Maybe it is not true for every woman, but when I drastically change my appearance to look more like a magazine and get a lot of positive feedback for it, there is always a feeling of betrayal I have that goes deeper than the flattery. I look more like a doll, and what people want from me is that I be a doll. But, I know that is not who I am or want to be. It also reminds me that people are suckers for media. So, while I don\u2019t think those are universal feelings, I do think that Lisbeth and I have similar enough outlooks that it throws me off that she would be so single-mindedly pleased with her boobs.Also, I will tell you right now that blond hair is not a good disguise. You go from dark hair to blond and you immediately get a lot more attention. Not that I think people would have identified Lisbeth, because I think they would have just been looking at her hair and boobs, but it is not a good disguise.So, I appreciate the academic comparisons of appearance, but I felt very disengaged with this story and these characters overall. Blomkvist is such a douche. Every time he said something, with his simpering patience, I wanted to punch him. The letter he wrote to Salander. Oh my god. I hate that guy. What a manipulative, selfish martyr. What was with Larsson being totally cool with Salander\u2019s statutory rape of the island kid? Oh wait, huh, did he say later in the book that the age for statutory rape in Sweden is super young? Nevertheless, why was Salander okay with that? Everything that happened at the beginning of this book was very disorienting. In GWTDT, you could have cut the first 100 pages, but in this, you could have cut the first 200. Not looking forward to the first 300 pages of The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest.I don\u2019t hate Salander at all, but I do feel somewhat indifferent about her. At the end of this one, when (view spoiler)[she dies and gets buried, I was like, \u201cHuh, that is a bold move,\u201d but I felt no emotion about it. And then it is made less bold by her rising again, but whatever (hide spoiler)]. Partly, regardless of what happens to her, I think Lisbeth\u2019s life is already forfeit to this war she is fighting, so it is difficult to have hopes for her. She isn\u2019t really a person, with her own dreams, because that isn\u2019t possible for her - she is a sort of slave to fighting hatred of women. That is important, and I love that about her character, but at the same time, it\u2019s not very human. It\u2019s not emotionally complex.Or, maybe it is ambivalence I feel about Lisbeth, not indifference, because in this one, like in GWTDT, there was a moment where she quoted something I recently said. It came about three-fourths of the way through the book, like it did in GWTDT, and it was sort of like a slap in the face. Like watching a robot take on my personality. Weird. I feel connected to Lisbeth through those things that she says, but it still always feels like Larsson was following me around, saw me say something, and wrote it down. And seeing me from the outside didn\u2019t really tell him what was behind the thing I said. That\u2019s how I feel about Salander \u2013 like Larsson couldn\u2019t crack through her character to tell me what was inside. Those are the things I want to know about a character: the guts and innards. I want an author to take them apart and show me the character\u2019s beating heart. That is not Larsson\u2019s skill, so I end up feeling disconnected.It is interesting that so much of this seems so purposeful, but an almost equal amount of it seems like a waste of space. After the first 200 pages, I was with the story, but until then I was doing some serious sighing and eye-rolling. I think it is a good policy to read these books in one sitting, and probably not while you\u2019re reading The Iliad, which is what I did. The Iliad is like a bowl of rich chocolate mousse, where you can take one bite and be satisfied for days. This book is like what I imagine a Billy\u2019s Pan Pizza to be: something sort of tasteless to rush through for the satisfaction of feeling full in the end. There is nothing to savor, but it has its place."}, {"Review": "I liked The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, I thought it was clever and well-written and Lisbeth Salander is a unique and intriguing character, but I wasn\u2019t knocked off my feet. I had the two follow up books on my shelf, but I wasn\u2019t in a hurry to get to them, just thinking I would when I could. This week I picked up The Girl Who Played With Fire and stepped back into Lisbeth\u2019s world, with a bang.This book is even better than the first one, perhaps because you already have a feeling of knowing who a least two of these characters are, Blomkvist and Salander. This book focuses more on Salander, it is in fact her story that drives it, and she is undoubtedly the most interesting part of these books. I am far behind the rest of the world in reading these books, but I will not be resting before I continue the series. It wasn\u2019t in the plan, and I don\u2019t really have the time because I am supposed to be finishing my challenges, but I am going right on to the next book in the series, because how can I sleep at night without knowing where Lisbeth goes from here?"}, {"Review": "In the second of his three volume series (well, at least it was three until Larsson's heirs hired someone to make a fourth from his notes) centered on the remarkable researcher and hacker Lisbeth Salandar and journalist Mikael Blomkvist, Larsson has delivered a totally engrossing page-turner. About to publish a book that reveals many dirty secrets concerning the international sex trade in Sweden, Blomkvist is caught up in a deadly race for the truth when his two authors are murdered and Salandar is accused of the crime. Larsson touches on corruption at all levels in this tale of women used and abused, treated like any other imported illegal product and powerless to protest. From low level johns to misogynist cops, from dark psychologists to supersecret intelligence agencies, many layers of Swedish society come under Larsson\u2019s microscope. It is not a pretty picture.Stieg Larsson - from famourauthors.orgSalandar, back in Sweden after an extended sabbatical, has grown somewhat from the character in The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, but remains hard-core, justifiably paranoid, blessed with almost magical techie powers (maybe a bit too magical), and an impressive command of several forms of combat. She is, as usual, totally victimized and misportrayed by the powers that be, and needs all her savvy to try to right the latest wrongs. Blomkvist is perplexed by Salandar\u2019s unwillingness to communicate with him, but he has had girl-troubles before. He remains what he was in volume 1, a dedicated, moral actor trying to use his skills to make Sweden a better, or at least more honest, place. Noomi Rapace as Lisbeth Salander - from wikimediaBlomkvist and Salandar are characters one can care about and the subject matter makes for pretty stark, sometimes cartoonish, delineations between good and evil. Maybe a bit more ambiguity would have worked too. But that is a quibble. This is a fun read, a book you will not want to put down, one that leaves you panting for volume 3. "}, {"Review": "You do NOT want to get on Lisbeth Salander\u2019s bad side\u2026 The anti-social genius computer hacker is back in this terrific thriller that improves on The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo. Following the events of the first book, Lisbeth has left Sweden and been traveling abroad for over a year. She\u2019s angry with Mikeal Blomkvist and has broken off all contact with him, but he has no idea why since Salander is far too socially awkward to ever explain herself or try to mend a damaged relationship. Blomkvist is busy himself since recent events have made him an extremely famous journalist and the magazine he co-owns, Millennium, is still riding high based on his work.As Salander returns to Sweden, she\u2019s unaware that an old enemy is plotting against her. Meanwhile, Blomkvist and the Millennium staff are preparing to publish a special edition and book based on the work of a free-lance journalist who has collected a damning amount of material on the Swedish sex-slave trade and the government officials and customers who have allowed it to flourish. When Salander gets word of this, she takes a personal interest, but in typical Salander fashion, she does it on her own terms and still won\u2019t contact Blomkvist. This time, her independent ways backfire and she ends up framed for murder.Misperceptions of her background soon make her tabloid fodder as she\u2019s on the run and the most wanted person in Sweden. A handful of friends, including Blomkvist, are convinced she\u2019s innocent and try to help, but Salander is far more concerned with getting revenge than clearing her name.As with The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo, the main appeal of this book is Salander. Lisbeth would be a huge pain in the ass to know in real life, but she makes for fascinating reading. Her continued refusal to engage an authority figure for any reason, and her pursuit of complete revenge against those she perceives as enemies make Lisbeth a wildly original character. She only has three ways to deal with other people. Mild acceptance of those she tolerates, completely ignoring the vast majority, or the scorched earth policy she uses against her enemies. There\u2019s no compromise or quitting for Lisbeth, and with personal grudges to settle in this one, she\u2019s pulling out all the stops.Reading the first two books by Larsson is a kind of enjoyable torture since we know that he only wrote one more before his death in 2004. I sincerely wish he\u2019d have been able to write a dozen books with Salander and Blomkvist because I already know I\u2019m going to miss them after the third one is released here in the U.S. Like the first book, this one also has a strong theme of exploring the misogyny and exploitation of women in Swedish government and culture, and that leads to some frank, but not graphic, scenes of rape and abuse. And to anyone interested in these books, I\u2019d definitely recommend reading The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo first because reading this one completely reveals the entire plot of that one."}], "Genre": "Crime", "ID": "5060378", "Desc": ""}
