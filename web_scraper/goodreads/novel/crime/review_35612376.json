{"Genre": "Crime", "Reviews": [{"Review": "3.5 Unexpected Stars for Hunting Annabelle It's no secret I enjoy reading about psychotic killers and aggressive, unremorseful sociopaths. Thrillers are my jam!  Hunting Annabelle  had all of that, along with a damaged MC that you can't help but feel some sympathy for. Yikes, did I just admit I found a sociopath endearing? Yes, I did! I was intrigued by the premise of the book. Sean Suh is a killer. He is fighting demons daily, trying not to kill again. Then he meets Annabelle. He falls hard - t"}, {"Review": "This book will make your mind spin and your palms sweat, an edge of your seat ride into crazy town!Oh how I love to spend time in the mind of a psychopath! Although in the case of Sean you were never quite sure if he was a psychopath or a victim? This really was what set this book a bit apart, the not knowing if you were sympathetic towards the bad guy or the good guy... but good or bad Sean was definitely an odd duck...Sean has recently been released from a psychiatric hospital, for reasons you"}, {"Review": "Unfortunately, Hunting Annabelle wasn't the story for me. I did not like this. It started out promising, as the author's writing is actually quite strong, but the story, yeah, just did not do it for me.Around the 50% mark it turned for me and I never got my interest back. Our protagonist, Sean Suh, is a Korean-American in his early 20s who you discover early on has some pretty strong urges to hurt and kill young women. In fact, you learn that he acted on these urges at least once in a severe eno"}, {"Review": "FIVE STARSSean Suh. His name doesn\u2019t exactly roll off the tongue, but that doesn\u2019t matter. It works. Sean Suh is the main character, otherwise known as the UNRELIABLE NARRATOR, in debut author Wendy Heard\u2019s novel, Hunting Annabelle. Is he a serial killer? Is he insane? Or just a one-time killer? You won\u2019t know until the very end\u2026(tease tease)!You will know that he is an odd duck. I guarantee he will command your full attention from page one.

I had no idea where this story was going, only that i was rooting for Sean, the tortured hero whose search for Annabelle means releasing his own inner demons.

From the moment I picked it up those pages were feverishly turning, faster and faster I flew until it was completely devoured. Despite having not been born until the late 1980s I thoroughly enjoyed the references to the times and thought it added a distinct mystique and intrigue to the story, and I loved how Heard builds her characters until they are complex, multi-layered and incredibly realistic.

The writing was great. The characters were interesting. It was well paced. The plot was engaging and full of twists and turns. I would have given it 5-Stars, but I thought the \"twist\" was a little far-fetched, and what in the heck happened to his (view spoiler)[ Mom?? (hide spoiler)] Other than that this was a great read.

The problem is that nobody seems to believe Sean's story as he is a schisophrenic and might have just imagined it all. In addition, once the police learn of Sean's violent past they believe it is Sean himself who is behind Annabelle's disappearance. But is he?This was an unusual read for me.

Are there people in the world that enjoy killing? Of course, serial killers have been documented from years ago to present day. The question is do I really want to read about them and for the first 3/4 of the book I sort of fooled myself that I did but then there is a sudden shift in this story and Sean, our hero (wrong word choice) moves forward in his search for Annabelle and something happen"}, {"Review": "This was a fantastic story told completely from Seans POV. Embarking on a journey together and as the story unfolded I felt I really got an insight into what made him tick.There was almost an air of obscurity, intrigue and mystery enveloping the whole narrative and this made for such compulsive reading with some real shockers thrown in along the way.I found myself questioning the hidden motives of every single individual here and as we are almost drip fed the answers this was almost at times lik"}, {"Review": "I really struggled with this one. The ending saved it for me, or this would have been 2 stars.I realize that this is a debut, so I have to give credit for that alone...I envy anyone who can put anything on paper and get it published.

I was hooked from page one and felt horrible for Sean even though he was a murderer. I never thought I could feel any kind of empathy for a murderer before but this book had me rooting for Sean the whole way through. I never knew what was coming next which made me keep on reading in hopes to guess what happened to Annabelle. Freaking amazing! Thank you Netgalley for the awesome read!!!"}, {"Review": "I always get a bit excited when I see a Korean-American lead in a book. Even if he's one of the most unreliable narrators I've come across in a while! No one seems to believe him when he says he saw Annabelle get abducted so it's up to him to find her. In doing so, he finds himself - or at least a part of him he was extremely confused about.As a debut, this is a fantastic start to a long career for Heard.
