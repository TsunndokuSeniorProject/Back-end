I got a really pleasant surprise a couple of years ago when I picked up Small Great Things on a whim and discovered that Picoult is actually much more vicious and hard-hitting than I'd expected.

I knew from the blurb, which is incredibly extensive, that there will be a shooting at a women\u2019s health clinic where abortions were being performed.

Set in a women's reproductive health services clinic, now becoming a rare commodity, the story kick starts with a bang with a desperate gunman shooting at those within the clinic and holding them hostage.

The reverse chronology of the chapters I found to be disjointed and annoying, and because of this I couldn't connect with any of the characters. And a graphic abortion scene? I mean really? Does anybody need to read that?

Her ability to see something from every point of view is the kind of extreme empathy we need more of in this county. I also love the vision of this novel. She examines abortion from the top of the iceberg and slowly works down to the broader scope of the issue, both from the perspective of pro-choice and pro-life characters.It was a risky move to write this in reverse chronological order, where every chapter"}, {"Review": "It\u2019s been years since I\u2019ve read Picoult.

The story is one that doesn\u2019t take sides but instead tries to shed light all around in a suspenseful setting.

"}, {"Review": "Once again, Jodi Picoult has given us a novel that is thought-provoking and poignant and powerful -- with a litany of compelling, deeply affecting characters. What makes this novel especially interesting is the narrative structure: Think \"Time's Arrow\" by Martin Amis. The story moves backwards, and then flashes forward to a stunning epilogue. And what a story it is: a hostage situation at the last clinic in Mississippi that performs abortions. So timely -- and so moving."}, {"Review": "I should have paid attention more fully, I didn\u2019t realise on Net Galley the publishers were only offering an exclusive first chapter, all this has done is frustrate me until I can get my hands on the entire book.This starts with a hostage situation.It\u2019s told in only the professional way a talented author can tell for her readers to actually feel scared in amongst all the mayhem.I can\u2019t wait to read more.
