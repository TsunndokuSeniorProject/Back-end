I\u2019m pleased to say that I absolutely LOVED it.The Friend had me gripped and intrigued throughout, as I wasn\u2019t sure where the story was going, so eagerly needed to read more to find out. This thought provoking psychological thriller was full of mystery, intrigue, suspense and an impressively manipulative character.

In my opinion, \u201cThe Friend\u201d took a very long time for anything (and I do mean anything) to happen, and when it did, it was very slow developing. 90% of the novel is the main character, Sophie, telling her story of meeting and becoming friends with the new woman in town, Emma. Emma appears to Sophie to be a perfect new friend , but some o"}, {"Review": "The book begins with Sophie on a train ride, hours from home, when she receives a devastating phone call that her 4 year old son has been rushed to the hospital and in need of surgery. Sophie left Ben with her good friend Emma and her son Theo for just one night. How did this happen? We flashback to the beginning of Emma and Sophie's friendship. Through these flashbacks we see all the warning signs that Emma may not be the friend she thinks she is. I have to be honest and say that this book just"}, {"Review": "EXCERPT: I had seen the worst of what two people can do to each other. My neighbours and friends. How could I be all right?I had walked into a room, happy and relaxed, with my son waiting for me on the doorstep. Unknowing. Innocent. Me. Sophie. The woman who allegedly had this chocolate box life. I had walked in smiling and been met with a scene which I never, ever want anyone to imagine. Not my son. Not my husband.

I can't even pin down the issue I had with it, but I felt it was kind of scattered and the jumps back and forth in time were not done smoothly. Obviously, I am in the minority in not having enjoyed The Friend, and if you do read it, I hope you like it much better than I did. Sadly, this was a miss for me. On to the next one!

But my own practice lacks that determination. I would try to avoid foreign authors may be due to my comfort zone with Indian authors.

Sophie is on a train and distraught as her son Ben is one of two boys in hospital. Her husband Mark is on the train as well. The story alternates between the present and the past.

Emma moves into Sophie's little town and they become fast friends. Emma is charming and spontaneous. Their sons are about the same age and they become good friends as well. Not everyone is so smitten with Emma though which causes a lot of conflict. Despite wild rumors flying about town, Sophie easily dismisses them as small town gossip.The Friend is fast paced and kept me up well into the night because"}, {"Review": "Sophie is on the train when she receives a chilling call informing her that her son Ben and his friend were in an accident.

Sophie, the main character, lives in a small village of Tedbury. She meets a new woman in Tedbury who has a son, just like she does. They become friends and the boys get along well with one another. A set of events leads Sophie's son to be injured while under the care of her new friend. Should she have trusted her friend to watch her son? A very fast read with lots of s"}, {"Review": "Well, now.

I read it in one sitting, the characters taking root in my head and demanding my full attention. And even now, days later, they haven't let go. I am still thinking of their motivations, the events that led them to do what they did. The writing is exquisite, there are so many wow moments.

I have to say that I was disappointed from the off. After 2 chapters it was evident what the plot line would be, mainly because the book jumped from present to past, present kind of giving the story away. Yes there were a few mediocre surprises along the way but nothing exciting and I found the characters very dull indeed. I kept reading as I tho"}, {"Review": "I was completely hooked from beginning to end in this fantastic psychological thriller.
