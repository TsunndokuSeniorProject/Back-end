No wonder it made people so sad\u201dA standing ovation for ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS THAT I'VE EVER READ, and L.J Shen's best story to date. It left me with the worst book hangover of the year!

Read.I know I say this each time I finish a book of hers, but this was my favorite LJ Shen book to date.  I was born into a glided cage.  If you like a modern day arranged marriage trope, welcome to your next addiction. This book? GAH! It had an anti-hero that only Shen can write; brutal and hard but completely redeemable. This is someone you won't be able to help"}, {"Review": "Oh wow, wow, wow. I\u2019m in awe right now. If you\u2019re a lover of L.J.

Mr Wolfe Keaton, the man that makes men quiver in their boots and women drop to their knees. He\u2019s sexy as sin with an attitude to go with it. He\u2019s ruthless and harsh and keeps his true feelings locked away. The Kiss Thief isn\u2019t your typical romance. It\u2019s a story about a nemesis and a villain.

The Kiss Thief was everything we've come to expect from L.J. Shen and more!! BEYOND PHENOMENAL!! It was emotional, poignant and gut wrenching and filled with a brilliant story that had me glued to every page. It was so perfectly written with every intricate detail written with the utmost care.

They say that all great love stories have a happy ending. I, Francesca Rossi, found myself erasing and rewriting mine until the very last chapter. One kiss. Two men. Three lives. Entwined together. And somewhere between these two men, I had to find my forever. LJ Shen crafts a deliciously angsty and riveting tale of a Villain and his Nemesis. This was one of those books that had me glued to every page, unable to put it down for a minute. It was a story that captivated me from the start"}, {"Review": "Arranged marriage? Older man?

"}, {"Review": "Perfection My first LJ book was Sparrow (Loved), followed by Defy (Lovely), then it all went downhill as I couldn\u2019t for the life of me get on board with subsequent books (particularly Vicious); yet, she stayed on my authors-to-read radar. So, to have this book be this amazing, to have an anti-hero so deliciously bad, to have a heroine who made me cheer, was everything I never knew I needed. I love this book from the depths of my cold heart. Bravo!"}, {"Review": "It's no secret that The Kiss Thief was one of my most anticipated releases of 2019. L. J. Shen is one of my favorite authors of all time, and I look forward to every single book she publishes. This time was a little different though. The mystery surrounding this book and the collective excitement of all of the other L. J. fans I knew took it to a whole new level!

Once again, Ms Shen has created a damaged alpha, a-hole hero that I couldn't help but fall head over heels in love with.Ms Shen has the amazing ability to take me through an entire emotional gamut.

When I found out this book the book was coming I was so exited that sleeping was hard for me. The exitement for this book got to an unhealthy level.I\u2019m so glad to say that this book was clearly worth my whole exitement.L.J. showed me a way of writing a love triangle in a way that didn't annoy me .

Wolfe and Francesca are so hot together! Wolfe is alpha, dark, brooding and cold but the author shows us he is vulnerable and honorable. Francesca is sweet, innocent, smart and kind. Her beauty glows bright from within and out! She is really a lady but she is strong and a fighter as well! And she is caught in the middle of a fight between two men. If you really love someone, do you fight for them or l"}, {"Review": "THIS. BOOK. Y'ALL. This book will ruin you for all other books in 2019. I would give it 10 stars, if I could. I would ask ot to marry me, if that were legal. I would stand up and slow clap, but I already did that at 4:00 a.m. when I read the final word. So go ahead and request January 9th off of work because trust me, when this thing hits your Kindle, you're not going ANYWHERE."}, {"Review": "Woweeeee! I read this in ONE day and oh my word! I knew it was going to be good but it blew me away! It's a fresh, dynamic, intoxicating read.

To be fair the book was engaging and well written. The MCs had great chemistry. Those things might be enough for you to enjoy and I didn't finish the book, so I might not be a fair judge.The amount of sexism, double standards and clich\u00e9 was disturbing and unbearable for me.

I am so sad to say that even though I enjoyed it, it fell kinda short for me. Wolfe and Francesca\u2019s sexual chemistry is off the charts from the moment they meet. I enjoyed their banter but I don\u2019t know there was something missing.

I just didn't enjoy it as much as I had hoped. I'm in the minority yet again here. I do really enjoy this author's ability to write a nasty H. And I enjoyed this H for the most part, but I think I just needed some more of the good to balance him out. I didn't like the fact that their dates were skimmed over. I think that would've helped a ton in redeeming him and his impulsively jerkish behavior! Yes, he groveled -- but because some of it felt skimmed ov"}, {"Review": "This book hit my kindle and I literally dropped the other book I was reading just to start this one! Nothing was going to stop me from devouring this book! Well except for the annoying part where I had to adult! But between that,I devoured this book completely!

It is captivating, unique, beautiful, and it drove me f***ing crazy. I have a thing where I get bored easily. If the relationship is smooth sailing, I dose off. Oh boy, that is NOT the case here....

I like angst in my books but the angst that comes with \"love triangles\" can actually drive a person to drink. Which is why I am normally not a fan of this trope. You know who I am a fan of though... L.J. Shen !!
