Renee has been shunted onto The Late Show, the Hollywood nightshift, after an injustice earlier, but oddly enough she has settled in there and somehow it suits her. Her partner is on bereavement leave and she is on her own when she is called to a home where a woman's body, heavily decomposing, is discovered. It is assumed to be murder but it does not tak"}, {"Review": "Sometimes when an author who has written many books in a series introduces a new character, I worry that the effect may be kind of like when sitcoms of the past introduced a new, young character (e.g., Cousin Oliver in \"The Brady Bunch\"), and it essentially ruins the series.When Michael Connelly introduced LAPD Detective Ren\u00e9e Ballard in last year's  The Late Show  (see my review), my fears were proven unfounded, because Ballard was such a complex, flawed, fascinating character (much like Harry"}, {"Review": "I love the Harry Bosch series and enjoyed the first Renee Ballard novel. So, I was excited to see the two detectives join forces. And I was not disappointed. One thing I love about Connelly\u2019s mysteries is that he doesn\u2019t sugarcoat the workload of a Detective. No one has the luxury of working a single case, especially a cold one. Both Renee and Harry have their hands full. There\u2019s lots of action here. This is one of those books that called to me and kept me reading well passed when I should have"}, {"Review": "It's a good read. \u2713 Readable police procedure and politics\u2713 Complicated and conflicted characters\u2713 Every character has there own agenda\u2713 An Avenger seeking justice for all\u2014every life mattersI didn't love it, but I wouldn't mind reading more."}, {"Review": "Many, many years ago I was drawn into a series featuring a young detective named Harry Bosch. I subsequently went on to read him again and again. Enticing cases he fdefinitel worked, but it was the detective, his life, both rather dark and gloomy, that kept me coming back again and again. There was just something g that drew me to this flawed but very noble character. Eventually as he aged, he found himself forced into retirement by the very department he had so long served. Yet, he could not le"}, {"Review": "Most of the books I pick up are fiction. I have one of those jobs that introduces me to life\u2019s less glamorous realities on a daily basis so I read for escape.

Faithfully, continuously & in large quantities. In fact, just cut a hole in the bottom of a 50 kg bag & leave it out on the kitchen floor, ok?

Two detectives from two jurisdictions, sharing their life stories and bound together by a single cold case that has them fully committed. While working the \u2018late show\u2019, LAPD Detective Ren\u00e9e Ballard comes across former LAPD legend Harry Bosch flipping through old files. Ballard soon learns that Bosch is working"}, {"Review": "I really enjoyed the first Ballard book, The Late Show, in which the young female cop showed some of the vim and vigor we\u2019d seen from Harry Bosch back when he too was an LAPD detective. Banished to the night shift after calling out her boss for sexual harassment, Ballard consequently nursed a chip on her shoulder as she remorselessly chased down her quarry. I thought it was a great book and seemed to promise a even money chance that at some point in the future she\u2019d share some page space with Bo"}, {"Review": "Detective Renee Ballard was working on her report for the night\u2019s killing back at Hollywood Station when she heard someone at the files on the other side of the office. That was Ballard\u2019s first meeting with retired LAPD Detective Harry Bosch. Bosch was working a nine year old cold case \u2013 the murder of a young fifteen year old which he was determined to solve. The nine year gap made it much harder.

In my opinion, Bosch is a given; there\u2019s no doubt he can easily carry the plot. Ballard, though, is almost an unknown in spite of reading the first book, The Late Show, where she is introduced. With that book, I had reservations about her being a stereotyped female Bosch. This book proves that may be the case, but it absolutely works and I\u2019m thrilled! Bosch has always done things his way and mostly gets the job done. Ballard is very similar;"}, {"Review": "If you're into stuff like this, you can read the full review.Rump and Rexit: \"Dark Sacred Night\" by Michael ConnellyConnelly even tries to paper over it later, having one of his character vaguely muse about how stupid it was.

And, it's such a perfect way to describe the paring of Ren\u00e9e Ballard and Harry Bosch.DARK SACRED NIGHT is the second Ballard book and the 29th Bosch. And, I was thrilled to get a copy of the book. Bosch was mentioned in The Late Show, the first Ballard book, but I never thought that we would get a crossover so early. I thought perhaps a cameo or something in the tw"}, {"Review": "Another stellar book from Michael Connelly. In this one he alternates established everyman protagonist Harry Bosch with newer main character Renee Ballard.Harry is always an empathetic character--strong, virtuous, sensitive--but Connelly and his editor have done a good job of providing an experienced, alternate, woman's voice in Renee Ballard.Highly recommended. Put Dark Sacred Night next in your TBR stack."}, {"Review": "The team up between Ballard and Bosch does a disservice to both: Dark Sacred Night is an unusual bland and sometimes even boring book which is more like a series of events than a story with a interesting plot. The ending is better then what came before, but the solution to the mystery came out of nowhere. Hopefully Connelly will get his groove back with his next novel."}, {"Review": "Michael Connelly is an great crime thriller writer with the excellent character Harry Bosch, but he doesn't stop there.

This is really the book that establishes the premise for the rest of the series. I think I am going to enjoy this partnership. Both Ballard and Bosch are lone characters, both are very experienced and very good detectives, very dedicated and willing to bend the rules. I have always been ambivalent about whether to start the Bosch series and I thought this new series would be a good way to dip my toe in the Bos"}, {"Review": "All the stars and more for my favourite detective Harry Bosch and Renee Ballard teaming up in Dark Sacred Night. Michael Connelly was one of the first \"grown up \" authors that my Dad got me hooked on when I was a teenager and all these years later he is still going strong. I was so very excited to be approved for an early copy of this book and writing a review for it terrifies me! I hope that I can do this book and the author justice.

Ballard is the new kid on the block, first introduced last year in the excellent \"The Late Show\".

Doesn\u2019t he get bored of knocking them out of the park every time? This one is up there with some of his best work and to say it\u2019s the 21st book in the Bosch series, that\u2019s no mean feat. This outing has a combination of the perennially awesome Bosch and the newcomer Ballard from his previous book, The Late Show (unsurprisingly, really good). I\u2019ve been a bit on the fence with these combo novels before due to the forced na"}, {"Review": "So this was the match-up that I never knew I needed. I am now wishing that Connelly had decided to match-up Harry with a strong female non-romantic lead before. I am not counting the books with him and Rachel Walling (see the Narrows, Echo Park, The Black Box, and The Burning Room). Fingers crossed that Connelly resists the urge to put them together. It is mentioned many times that Bosch is as old as her father (Renee) but Connelly also heavily implies that Renee has issues over the death of her"}, {"Review": "After I finished the first book in this series that brings together retired LAPD detective Harry Bosch and current detective Renee Ballard, I knew I wanted to read more. Admittedly, I wasn't all that taken with Ballard in The Late Show, but the aging Harry has never failed to reel me in. It's much the same here; I'm still not an all-out Ballard fan, but by golly, the story is so good that it didn't matter. And, the more I learn about Ballard the more appealing she's becoming (I very much like th"}, {"Review": "I love these Michael Connelly books because they always have great plots and intense characters. I wish Renee would get a house though. She is like a beach bum detective right now but it does make her more interesting. The crime plot was a very fascinating one with some good roller coaster moments. I love The team of Renee and Harry working together and I hope it continues into the next novels of the series. My quick and simple overall: entertaining and fast-paced. A great crime read."}, {"Review": "Here's a double helping of Michael Connelly's creations as Renee Ballard teams up with Harry Bosch in another well written police procedural.Connelly juggles multiple plot lines as effortlessly as usual, & continues to develop one of his latest characters along with one of his oldest. On the down side Connelly once again uses a tired crime cliche, which lets the book down a little. Without giving this irritating piece of lazy writing away I'll just says that the author used it in the previou"}, {"Review": "Dark Sacred Night by Michael Connelly throws together his longtime character Harry Bosch and LAPD Detective Renee Ballard in another grand police procedural.
