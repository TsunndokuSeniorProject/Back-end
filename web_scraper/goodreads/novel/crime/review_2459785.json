{"Name": "In the Woods", "Image": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1538771792l/2459785.jpg", "Reviews": [{"Review": "If I could, I'd probably rate this at 1.5 stars-- it ultimately pissed me off, and annoyed me throughout, but it was good enough to keep me reading and I suppose that should count for something.Maybe my opinion has been influenced by reading THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO immediately prior to this one. That book wasn't perfect, but it had characters you rooted for, didn't wallow too much in pop culture references, and most importantly IT SOLVED THE FRIGGING MYSTERY. Let's go through a few of these points. First, I don't think I've ever read a mystery novel with a less likable main character/narrator. Rob (Adam) Ryan is an asshole, plain and simple. Sure, he's been warped by his childhood and circumstances, but he does just about every annoying thing you could possibly imagine-- he constantly navel-gazes and feels self pity, he sleeps with then immediately plays the stereotypical male \"I don't want anything to do with you now\" role with his female partner (the person we were told was his best friend, and whom he would never ever sleep with), he acts like an idiot over the 17 year old villain/ temptress/ psychopath/ whatever betraying his partner, and by the end of the book he is worse off than ever. I know that lots of detectives (esp. in hard-boild stories) are unlikable, and have many personal issues, but this guy just took the cake. I wanted to take a baseball bat to his head. To make matters worse, French throws in this little gem towards the end of the novel:\"I am intensely aware, by the way, that this story does not show me in a particularly flattering light. I am aware that, within an impressively short time of meeting me, Rosalind had me coming to heel like a well-trained dog: running up and down stairs to bring her coffee, nodding along while she bitched about my partner, imagining like some starstruck teenager that she was a kindred soul. But before you decide to despise me too thoroughly, consider this: she fooled you, too. You had as good a chance as I did. I told you everything I saw, as I saw it at the time. And if that was in itself deceptive, remember, I told you that, too: I warned you, right from the beginning, that I lie.\"As if that excused anything... and NO, she didn't \"fool\" me, because YOU'RE the narrator and YOU'RE the one telling the story. This paragraph probably ticked me off more than anything else in the book.Second, the book seriously dates itself with little pop culture references... from Simpsons quotes to mentions of Ricky Martin and The Simple Life. Gah. The beginning of the book felt like a very special episode of FRIENDS where Chandler, Monica and Ross solve a mystery. I'm a pretty big pop culture type of guy, but the references dropped in this novel just annoyed me.The last part is a bit more controversial I suppose. There are two central mysteries in this book-- the first, what happened to Katy, DOES get solved in the course of the novel (the \"big break\" in the case is our hero realizing suddenly that the murder probably took place in a shed about 20 feet from where the body was found! Really?? No one bothered to think of that for a month?), but the deeper mystery about what happened to Rob/Adam and his friends is never resolved. Your mileage may vary about how annoying that is. Truth be told, it didn't annoy me as much as the fact that the true \"villain\" of the modern mystery walks without being punished in any way. How incredibly unsatisfying. I know this was a first novel, so hopefully things will improve for her second book. I know, also, that this book won a major award and that lots of people seem to love it to death, so maybe I don't know what I'm talking about.----Since this review seems to be read by quite a few people, I thought I'd include in the review a bit of further rumination that I had in the comments section below.----In a bit of serendipity, I just finished reading Graham Moore's THE SHERLOCKIAN this past weekend. In the book, there's a quote from the narrator (supposedly based on some thoughts from Arthur Conan Doyle) talking about how a mystery must have a conclusion lest the audience be left unhappy and upset:\"Can you write a mystery story that ends with uncertainty? Where you never know who really did it? You can, but it\u2019s unsatisfying. It\u2019s unpleasant for the reader . There needs to be something at the end, some sort of resolution. It\u2019s not that the killer even needs to be caught or locked up. It\u2019s that the reader needs to know. Not knowing is the worst outcome for any mystery story, because we need to believe that everything in the world is knowable. Justice is optional, but answers, at least, are mandatory. And that\u2019s what I love about Holmes. That the answers are so elegant and the world he lives in so ordered and rational. It\u2019s beautiful.\u201d I'll take Holmes over Ryan any day of the week. "}, {"Review": "Some wounds will never heal, and there will forever be a Rob Ryan-shaped scar in my heart.Some books are written deliberately to provoke sadness. It's fucking easy to induce someone to tears when the book is about a dying cancer patient with a labrador retriever whose leg has been amputated, with one ear missing. The most effectively emotional books are the ones where you least expect it. The ones that sneak up on you.There are differing degrees of sadness, the type that makes one curl into a ball, sobbing in the wee hours of the morning. I still can't pass by a bookshelf containing the book Forbidden without recalling that memory. Then there are books such as these. It doesn't make a person shudder in pain as much as it leaves one with an overwhelming sense of sadness and a feeling of unfulfillment. Of loss. When I picked up this book, so many years ago, I never knew I was setting myself up for heartbreak. Ask anyone who's read this book. Their reply will range anywhere from MY FEELS to WHY DOES TANA FRENCH DO THIS TO US?!The damnedest thing is, this book wasn't even MEANT to be sad. It just sneaks up on you. It makes you fall in love with the main character. It makes you sympathize with him. Rob Ryan is not a bad boy. He's a lost one. He is the kind that brings out what little remnants of maternal feelings there exists inside me. He is wounded, without being a new adult asshole. Don't get me wrong, he is sometimes an asshole...while not intending to be.He is a little boy, who behaves carelessly without intent to harm. He is imperfect, he runs the other way when the going gets tough. He is scared to face the past, he can't think about the future. All he can do is live in the present, wholly devoting himself to his work because it's the only way he can avoid his shadows. He would make a terrible husband. He would make a horrendous boyfriend. He will break your heart, and I don't even care.I just want to love him. I just want to take care of him. I want to erase his hurt. I want to obliterate his pain. Rarely has there been a character who has broken my heart so badly. This is a detective novel, but it's not really. Don't get me wrong, there is an ample amount of investigation in the book. It can hold it's own against any fucking detective novel out there. It just doesn't feel that way because to me, this book is more poetry. I have rarely encountered better writing. I have scarcely encountered more evocative passages. The other books in this series does a better job of investigation, but I don't care. As far as I'm concerned, the series begins, and ends---the universe revolves around this book.Do yourself a favor. Lose yourself...\n...in the woods.\n"}, {"Review": "Though the isbn is the same as the one pictured, my edition of this book has a much creepier cover and tagline:Needless to say, I was completely expecting something a bit dark and twisted, a creepy psychological murder mystery with an outcome I never would have seen coming. And I got that. But I never expected this book to leave me feeling so... sad. And you know why? Because I cared. Ms French carefully builds up a complex personality for each of her characters, complete with a past, a sense of humour and some serious issues to go with it all, and you can't help but care what happens to the detectives even more than you care what happens with the case.Having now read all her other works, I can confirm she isn't just a one trick pony. I also feel more forgiving of this book's ending, which I know bothered many other readers. In hindsight, frustrating as it is, I find it oddly perfect.In The Woods is a deeply psychological read that explores the nature of psychopaths and memory - or lack of. The story is narrated by Rob Ryan, a detective on the Dublin murder squad, who is sent back to his home town in hopes of unravelling the case of a local child murder. A young girl found dead in the very same woods in which Detective Ryan played as a child. But Rob Ryan has a secret. Years ago two of his friends disappeared whilst playing in those woods and whilst he was with them and a witness to whatever happened, he retains no memory of the events. His friends were never found. The question is: will this new case bring back old memories? Is there some piece of evidence that's waited twenty years to be found in those woods?A case like the one Rob and his partner - Cassie - face would leave a very personal mark on anybody, you cannot investigate the murder and sexual assault of a child and keep it just business as usual. As the investigation progresses and leads the pair in a number of directions only to meet with dead end after dead end, it begins to take its toll on the two detectives, they come out of it very different people from those we knew at the beginning. It seemed a very realistic and rather sad progression.I'm not saying that every wordy paragraph in this beautifully-written novel was needed, but I personally didn't want them to be taken out. I think the main reason I enjoyed this novel so much was because it is about far more than a murder mystery; it's about all the people involved and how they are affected. And I was honestly on the verge of tears after reading the ending and then reading friends' reviews of the second book in this series and discovering that we never get to hear more from Rob.There's a touch of love in this book, just a touch, not enough to be called romance. No descriptive sex. No sweet-nothings. Nothing like that. And yet, it still fucking broke my heart.Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Tumblr"}, {"Review": "\"What I am telling you, before you begin my story, is this - two things: I crave truth. And I lie.\"This book is brilliantly cruel - a story of deep and painfully real psychological f*ckery masquerading as a murder mystery. There's nothing \"feel good\" about it. If you like a book to leave you feeling warm and fuzzy at the end, it's not for you. If you like neat resolutions - it's not for you (and if you already read this book, you know exactly what I'm talking about). If you hate being left with a new question for each question that this story answered - well, yet again, it's not a book for you. But I loved it. I loved every page of it, every wordy paragraph, every depressing turn of the story, every soul-shattering instance, every painfully real mistake of the protagonist. I chose reading this book over sleep - a decision I almost came to regret later, having to work a 14-hour day on 3 hours of sleep (\"Hi, it's Dr. (yawn) Nataliya returning a (yawn) page (yawn)... Scalpel (yawn) please!)- but hey, we all make decisions we wish we could take back (hey, just like Rob Ryan in this book!). And it ultimately was fully worth it.\"I suppose you can say my real weakness is a kind of long-sightedness: usually it is only at a distance, and much too late, that I can see the pattern.\"Rob Ryan is a detective in the (imaginary) Dublin Murder Squad, assigned to investigate a senseless murder case of a 12-year-old ballet dancer Katy in a little town of Knocknaree. What his supervisors don't know is that 20 years ago he was among the three children who went to play in the woods near Knocknaree, and was the only one to come back under unbelievably strange circumstances, wearing shoes full of blood, and with no memory of what happened to his best friends who forever disappeared in the woods. The investigation forces Rob to revisit the place that has such painful associations for him, and slowly, day by day, rips his heart to shreds and destroys him a little bit at a time. And it's not the murder story (stories?) but Rob's despair, mistakes, pain, and downward spiral and self-destruction that makes this book so painfully real and fascinating to read. It is a reminder that our worst monsters ultimately do live within ourselves, and that we are our own worst enemies even without ever meaning to be.\"And then, too, I had learned early to assume something dark and lethal hidden at the heart of anything I loved. When I couldn't find it, I responded, bewildered and wary, in the only way I knew how: by planting it there myself.\"The heart of this book is the story of a friendship between Rob and his partner Cassie Maddox (view spoiler)[and the ultimate destruction of it that Rob's downward spiral eventually brings (hide spoiler)]. Rob and Cassie start off enjoying that incredible, intense and yet easy, all-forgiving and natural closeness of a friendship I think every person in the world (non-sociopathic, to be exact) longs for. It's a friendship too beautiful to not be doomed. It is a friendship that many people do not have a privilege to enjoy after they have grown out of their childhood. It's a friendship that brings nostalgic longing from the very first pages on which it is described. And it is, without a doubt, my favorite part of this book.\"But a girl who goes into battle beside you and keeps your back is a different thing, a thing to make you shiver. Think of the first time you slept with someone, or the first time you fell in love: that blinding explosion that left you crackling to the fingertips with electricity, initiated and transformed. I tell you that was nothing, nothing at all, beside the power of putting your lives, simply and daily, into each other's hands.\"This book takes us onto a journey to the sadness and bleakness and hopelessness. The mystery of what happened twenty years ago to Rob, the psychological fallout he still suffers from decades later, the senselessness of the new murder, (view spoiler)[the lack of justice as we would have loved to see it done (hide spoiler)], the burden of crushing loneliness, the habitual cruelty of the world, the casual mentions of the depressing parts of the society like the persistent corruption. None of this is a feel-good reading. None of this has a resolution that the readers hope for (or any resolution at all for some of the above!). It is painful and yet touching and beautiful, and so unbelievably close to perfect - at least it was for me.\"For a moment, I felt as if the universe had turned upside down and we were falling softly into an enormous black bowl of stars, and I knew, beyond any doubt, that everything was going to be alright.\"I loved this book to pieces, even though I could not shake off the overwhelming feeling of sadness and hollowness after finishing it. I loved it despite (or maybe because?) of the frustrating incompleteness of some plot lines, the frequent lack of resolution, and the unfulfillment of my wishes for the characters and events. I know I will read it again in the future, curious to know how my reading experience will be changed once I know what's coming. In the meantime, I highly recommend it. 5 stars with no hesitation.\"There was a time when I believed I was the redeemed one, the boy borne safely home on the ebb of whatever freak tide carried Peter and Jamie away. Not any more. In ways too dark and crucial to be called metaphorical, I never left that wood.\"-------------Catie's wonderful review that made me pick up this book is here.My review of the sequel, The Likeness, is here.

My review of the fifth book, The Secret Place, is here."}, {"Review": "This book is amazing... really truly excellent. I took a risk at the UTEP library just picking this out at random... & what true serendipity it was! This particular week was rife with parties & late nights (daytime reserved for sleep) and all throughout \"In the Woods\" was a faithful companion... it was a pleasure to get back into it, for it's a dense and meticulous, brilliant piece of literature. It kicks \"Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\"'s ass... people, read this instead!!You feel so much for the trio of detectives trying to uncover the murder of a teenage girl atop a medieval altar in the woods. The backdrop is Ireland of modern day, & not since 2003's \"Veronica Guerin\" or more recently the romantic comedy \"Leap Year\" have I wanted to visit the Emerald Isle so much. Tana French establishes the whodunnit with elegant prose not fit for a bestseller (it is written more a-la Haute Literature than Global Bestseller a-la-mediocre) and the twists & turns are calibrated to hit the protagonist's psyche in clear-cut precision: he too was a victim in the same woods years earlier. Alcoholism and despair follow our lad about, and although it spreads itself way too much in the end, it is the best psychological thriller, I believe, since Robert Harris' \"The Silence of the Lambs.\"PS When will I read its sequel? After 8 years it can't come soon enough..."}, {"Review": "Seriously, man, I wanted to rate this book higher than two stars. I almost went with three, but I just can't do it. This book felt like it ran this long, exhausting marathon only to collapse into a heap, huffing and puffing just before it crossed the three-star line. Right now it's laying there lifelessly. It might get up slowly and crawl across that line later, but I doubt it.The protagonist of this book really, really annoyed me. It felt like a parody of one of those old black-and-white movies where the picture freezes and the guy steps out toward the camera, lights a cigarette, pulls his hat down, and goes into this long monologue about life or women or his past or whatever. The action would pick up or a new lead would be uncovered, and here comes Rob rambling on for pages and pages.... and pages.Example:Cassie: Oh wow! This thing we just found could connect this murder to events from your past! WHOA!Rob: That is amazing! Great job, Cass!::Rob steps toward the camera::Rob: Yeah, Cassie was like that. She was always finding connections to things and blah blah blah. She made a great partner because hey remember that time 20 years ago when my friends and I were in the woods and blah blah blah I want to tell you about all the people I work with and give you a brief description of each one of them and also explain in detail how my boss is and blah blah blah. My mind is trying to remember what happened 20 years ago and you know Cassie and I are great partners and we're best friends and people think we're dating but blah blah blah. Hey, time flies, man. Did I tell you what happened to me as a child? Did I remind you about Katy? Also, her family sure is weird. The people at the dig site are weird. Everyone is a suspect blah blah blah. Let me pause here to tell you how I deal with my roommate and also O'Kelly and my childhood and my current job and Katy and her weird family and interrogation and coffee and vodka and this dream I had and looking for clues and in the woods and we keep hitting dead ends and and and and and blahhhhhhhhhhhh.Cassie: Hey, Rob. We have a suspect.Rob: ...]"}, {"Review": "After much waiting and some significant 'biblio' peer pressure, I have finally decided to take the plunge into the world of Tana French and the Dublin Murder Squad. In the summer of 1984, three children went missing in the woods on the outskirts of Dublin. When authorities arrived, they found one boy, Adam 'Rob' Ryan, delirious and unsure what had happened to him. The other two were presumed dead, their bodies never found. Flashing forward two decades, Ryan has recreated himself, using his middle name, and finds himself working as a Homicide detective in Dublin. Partnered with his best friend, Cassie Maddox, they are used to the most gruesome of scenes. When Ryan and Maddox are called to an archeological dig site, they discover the body of twelve year-old Katy Devlin, buried under a ceremonial headstone. This sparks many disturbing memories for Ryan, as it is the exact location of his childhood trauma. While beginning to amass clues in the Devilin murder, Ryan is forced to revisit his past, told in a number of developing flashbacks. He tries to make sense what happened to his two best friends as he remembers the news they shared leading up to that summer afternoon. The deeper Ryan and Maddox dig into the possible motives for the crime, the more suspects they unearth who might harbour the necessary grudge to kill young Katy. Could the murder investigation hold the key to solving the crime from that long ago summer night? Ryan struggles to come to terms with this while also balancing the burden of having no means of helping the two people he loved the most. Simultaneously, his personal interactions with Maddox open paths of confusion and animosity that may be irreparable. French makes her debut in stunning fashion, sure to impress all those who enjoy a police procedural of the highest order.While I have heard much of Tana French in the last few months, I had been inundated with new series in my 2016 reading journey that I was not sure I ought to add another collection to my list. However, the series held a few unique aspects, one of which was its setting in Ireland, a place I hold close to my heart. After allowing myself to try at least one novel, I discovered that French tells a story that proves as gripping as some of the great European series I have discovered in the past couple of years. The Rob Ryan character is both gripping and baffling, which caught my attention from the start. His work on the Homicide Squad and the struggles tied to his youth proved to be a thread throughout the story and remained relevant until the final pages. While French takes her time in the story's progression, the drawn out development is done in such an effective way that the reader forgets the pace at which the story matures. The plot is both straightforward and convoluted, as the reader encounters twists and dead ends as they relate to motives for the crime. Strains between the characters help bridge portions of the investigation narrative, but might surge into being central plot lines for subsequent novels. French takes on a great deal in her debut piece but comes out of the experience firmly rooting herself in the genre by providing a unique flavour. I am eager to lose myself in her subsequent novels, which I hope are just as riveting.Kudos, Madam French for blowing my mind and creating an instant fan out of me. I cannot wait to rush into the second novel, hoping that Ryan and the rest of the gang prove equally as compelling.Like/hate the review?

(see how flexible that kind of assessment is??) it's not all \"wee bairns\" and Lebor Gab\u00e1la \u00c9renn, but syntactically it is delightfully irish, and that part of it is a pleasure to read.dunno - this isn't the worst, i just figured that genre fiction had to play by certain rules in order to be invited into the clubhouse. tana french is a subversive lass, aye, to be sure.go ahead, read it, and come howl with me.come to my blog!"}, {"Review": "This was an Edgar Award finalist, and that means a mystery, right? Well, we get a tease at the beginning--little boy survives some sort of mysterious mischief in the local woods, the two friends with him are never seen again, and when he's found his shoes are filled with blood and he's unable to speak or recall anything. Cool, huh? I would go along for a ride that works out that story (how'd the blood get IN his shoes, not just on them, etc.), even if I have to sit through another peripheral murder that takes place in the same location many years later, when said boy has become a--wait for it--police detective. Well, I got all involved in the story, even looked forward to finishing it by reading straight into the wee hours one night, and I could not believe the ending: we never find out what happened in the woods all those years ago, and we couldn't care less about the new murder that Bloody Shoes has solved now that he's all grown up. I call that a cheap trick, and I'm not even going to pick up French's second book with this character (if she writes one) to find out if she's beginning a series and wants to stretch out the story--I felt cheated, and I'm done.

You can read a thousand reviews talking about it, so I\u2019ll keep it short. The writing is honestly stunning, much better - in my opinion - than Gillian Flynn or Paula Hawkins\u2019 styles. I had no clue where the mystery was going. And the lead characters, Rob Ryan and his partner / best friend Cassie Maddox were super compelling - and no romance, bonus point! I especially adored Cassie fucking Maddox; her backstory with a friend from college honestly broke my heart. All the ingredients for a perfect book. Maybe even a five. I like the characters and I like the writing, so I should have liked this book, right?I am going to try to explain this as spoiler-free [and what spoilers exist are noted] as possible: the ending of this book is maybe one of the most unsatisfying things I have ever read in my whole life.

What is up with that hair clip in the forest and the blood inside Rob\u2019s shoes? NO ONE FUCKING KNOWS. I\u2019m sure this is framed in the minds of many readers as some kind of deeper meaning about memory. You know what I thought, honestly? Tana French wrote herself into a corner with a fucking ridiculous case and then ran out of time on her deadline and decided to leave it open. How not to write a decent crime book 101. And\u2026\u2026.. so the only actual thing that is wrapped up is the current case, which is the only thing in this entire goddamn book that wraps up and I still don\u2019t like it. It\u2019s tagged. Don\u2019t say I didn\u2019t warn you. (view spoiler)[I sort of despise the connotations of a girl pretending to be a rape victim to manipulate her boyfriend into killing someone.

Hers is not the terse and journalistic objectivism of hard-boiled literature, nor the overly technical and post-modernistic dialect of more recent crime writing. French\u2019s language is rich and erudite, blending the best of many genre\u2019s into a style that is fresh, unique and intoxicating.Told from a first person perspective of Dublin homicide detective Rob Ryan, French has crafted a multi-layered psychological thriller that is more than simply an investigation into the murder of a 12-year-old girl living in the rural, suburban estate of Knocknaree. Ryan, something of an unrealistic narrator, has deeply buried and scarring issues of his own as he was the lone survivor of an unsolved disappearance involving himself as a young boy and two of his childhood friends in Knocknaree in the mid-eighties. The facts of this cold case are intertwined and lurk tauntingly at the edges of the present inquiry.French also mixes in several sub-plots into her narrative that combine to produce an atmosphere of tension and heightening disquietude, plunging resolutely towards the end. The culmination of the many loose ends is tied together in French\u2019s talented and sophisticated work. It is this group dynamic, the interactions between Ryan and his partner Cassie Maddox and the other members of the squad, as well as the collection of witnesses, that elevates this to a more mature and satisfying novel.The little girl is found on an archeological site, being quickly mined and researched because of an interstate going in, and this sub-plot allows French to explore Irish culture, both present and ancient. Irish history and pre-history, the archeological dig and multiple Celtic references all combine to evoke a sense of paranormal enigma to this already highly entertaining story.A great book, I\u2019ll return to visit Ms. French\u2019s writing again."}, {"Review": "I will agree that this book is gorgeously written, and the characters are well crafted and sympathetic. That's what kept me reading through the various absurd plot points. An example: the narrator, as a child, is found in the woods, his shoes full of blood, with his two best friends mysteriously missing. He comes back years later as a detective to investigate another murder in the same small estate, and no one recognizes him including the mother of one of those best friends. Oh, PLEASE. And then, after all that, while you do find out who committed the recent murder, the question of what happened to the protagonist and his friends years ago is never resolved. I mean, WTF? the murder of Katy Devlin is a McGuffin--a plot device that motivates the characters or advances the story, but the details of which are of little or no importance otherwise. The real mystery is left hanging in the air. I put the book down at the end and said out loud, \"are you [bad word:] KIDDING ME?\"So, the kindest thing I can say about this book is \"enjoy the journey, but realize you're going to roll your eyes in disbelief a lot on the way, and then you're not going to end up anywhere.\" "}, {"Review": "I didn't damn like it, but I owned it and it's on one of my badge challenges so I read it.

Tons of friends have loved this book and I'm glad you did, it just wasn't for me. It has to be a major mystery for me to like it. I'm not big on mystery books. I will scroll through and like all of my friends reviews on the book regardless of what you thought. I don't have time to waste going to the home page or profiles to find reviews. So for now it's just liking friends who have reviewed or starred the same books. So happy Reading and thank you to friends that still support me.

In ways too dark and crucial to be called metaphorical, I never left that wood.\"\n\nI know that I ought to gather my thoughts to organize them or whatever I usually do before writing a review, especially when the last page let me shell-shocked as In the Woods did. But I can't. I'm leaving tomorrow and I'm not one for writing reviews weeks after having read the damn book. I'm actually in awe of people who manage to do just that. I think that it says something about me : in the end, I'm an emotional reader, and I'll always hold to the bewilderment and wonder I feel when fictional stories get to me in such a strong level. And I just began too many sentences with I. Ugh. Bear with me, would you?In the Woods affected me in a way that I didn't expect, slowly enveloping me in its sickeningly sweet lure. Little by little, I've been rocked by a false sense of safety, by the discreet and uncertain laughs, proofs of Rob and Cassie's complicity. Of course I saw the warnings, the insights, yet I chose to ignore the bad taste in my mouth, the inexorable growth of my doubts and then the pang of betrayal and sadness. God, this book let me so fucking sad. Hollowed. There's nothing, really, that I could say to convince you to give it a chance, and many reviewers did it before me and with much more eloquence. So I'll only say this : rarely did I feel that the character's personality - whether they're likeable or not - was so besides the point as when reading this book. Is Rob a jerk? Maybe, but I don't care, he's real, all of them are real to me. I care so much, og my god, do I care for him still. Did I guess some clues before he did? Yes, actually, I did, but again, it changes nothing to the way I feel right now, to the sheer awe still palpable in me when I'm writing these (clumsy) words. (view spoiler)[Do I feel some kind of bond with him, because in my early 20s I've come across a girl (a woman, really) who acted the same way as Rosalyn and that I fell for it? Yes, definitely. (hide spoiler)]I am frustrated, does that show? I'm just so sick of writing that, it's not perfect but - god, I'm so fed up with that sentence and I write it way too often. Nothing's perfect. Life is far from perfect (or everybody would look at populists and say, What The Hell, do I look like an idiot to you?!). Tana French pictures the unfairness and imperfection of it all perfectly. It's enough for me. Of course it's enough. PS. One day later and I'm still dazzled and yeah, so very much sad. It will linger, I just know it.For more of my reviews, please visit:\n\n\n"}, {"Review": "This book is tricksy.Rob Ryan is a veteran homicide detective with the Dublin police along with his best friend and partner, Cassie Maddox, and the two start working a case involving a young girl found murdered at the site of an archaeological dig. Sounds like it could be the cold open of an episode of CSI: Ireland, right? Ah, but that\u2019s only part of the story. Rob is actually from the area where the girl is found, and 22 years before he and two friends went to play in the nearby woods and something very bad happened. Rob was found with blood covered shoes and no memory of what happened to the other kids. They were never found, and Rob has done his best to disassociate himself from the event. When they find a piece of evidence that seems like it could link their fresh murder to the disappearance of his friends, Rob and Cassie decide to keep this under wraps so that they can investigate without potentially dragging up Rob\u2019s history while they determine if the two crimes are related.But that\u2019s only part of it. As the case progresses it sprawls to also involve a hot button issue of a new motorway being built through the archaeological site, potential political corruption and indications of child abuse while Rob and Cassie find themselves under extreme pressure to solve the crime. The added burden of Rob\u2019s secret takes an increasing toll on them as they have to find ways to include his knowledge without admitting how they got it.I told you it was tricksy\u2026This is a really nice piece of work and a solid debut novel from Tana French that starts off like a crime thriller with the twist of Rob\u2019s history, but there\u2019s more going on here than that. I particularly liked the way she portrays Rob and Cassie\u2019s close relationship in the early stages of the investigation, and then how it the plot tests it. French also has a nice way of leading a reader down a path that seems somewhat familiar to any fan of crime fiction, but then zigs and zags into different directions. It was a particularly nice touch that with his first person narration that Rob would typically be the most sympathetic character, but French doesn\u2019t hesitate to have him do things that make him downright unlikeable at times. I had three or four occasions where I was seriously hoping that someone would punch him in the balls. However, there are some pacing problems where things seem a bit repetitive and slow that probably could have been hurried along a bit. I\u2019ve also seen a fair amount of complaining about the ending, but I actually loved it. (view spoiler)[French pulls off a nice two-fer here. First, decoying us into thinking that Cassie and Rob got their killer only to pull the rug out from under them, and it\u2019s even worse that she gets away with it because it was one of Rob\u2019s numerous fuck-ups that really enabled it. As for not knowing what happened to Rob\u2019s friends, I\u2019m OK with that. The story wasn\u2019t so much about what happened to them as it how effected Rob, and how his failure to ever really face and deal with what happened leads him to disaster here. I also give French credit for not giving into a temptation that a lot of writers would have and having Cassie forgive Rob. He was pretty much a bastard, and her dumping of him as a friend, partner and lover then moving on without him was a powerful statement about how badly he managed to botch his life, not just the case. (hide spoiler)]I was leaning towards 3 stars when it seemed that things slowed down in the middle, but some of the clever twists and turns at the end got it back to 4 for me."}, {"Review": "It's been a while since I have read a book that has left me so utterly devastated, a book entailing such a profound emotional investment that having finished it I feel a gaping emptiness within, a sense of loss. It feels like my heart has been simultaneously crushed into pulp under the weight of the tragedies that descend on the lives of a handful of characters and blown to smithereens. And I would never be able to pick up the pieces and glue them back together into a throbbing whole again.I read In the Woods while on vacation, whenever I took breaks from watching wave after wave crash on to the shore with the familiar rip-roaring intensity of the sea. I read this even when I was too tired to stay up till late, lying on an unfamiliar bed with a sheet of dubious hygiene standards. I read this during prolonged car rides. And every time I had to tear my eyes away from its pages, I felt a pang of irritation.As I made my way toward the bone-chilling climax of this narrative, awake at an unholy hour, I distinctly remember breaking out in a sweat on a cool December night to boot. Sleep became an alien entity and, come hell or high water, I knew I would not wrench myself away from this fantastic make-believe world of a small town and the sinister occurrences that tied the lives of its residents in the most twisted way possible. I longed to stay trapped in the eerie magic spell cast by the woods, under the ominous shadows of leafy canopies of pine and beech, caught up in a hazy daydream playing hide and seek with Peter, Jamie and Adam. My heart ached for the two children who never returned home from their beloved woods, who were never found again and the way the tragedy of their mystifying disappearance dealt a crushing blow to the life of their traumatized playmate who returned unharmed. It wept for Rob and Cassie and their missed chances.This book isn't about crime and punishment, it isn't about the science of deduction or smooth-talking, fedora-sporting detectives smartly arriving at inference after inference and nabbing the culprit in style. I almost crave for the standardized simplicity of regular crime thrillers at this moment, the stories which conveniently compartmentalize the crime and the police procedure, the good guys and the bad guys. At least a book like that would not have left me feeling so desolate and bereft of any happy feeling. But this book took my breath away with its ability to instill so much life in each one of its characters that their distress became my own, with its ornate but never ostentatious prose and the way it deftly narrated a story infused with the dull shades of a sadness so affecting. Tana French foregoes all the spick and span categorizations here, thumbs her nose at the usual pigeon-holing. Instead with consummate skill, she outlines the faint traces of humanity in the most brutal impulses, acknowledges the messed up ways in which this bizarre drama of life plays out and how a neat tying up of all loose ends seldom happens in reality. Sometimes, life is that merciless and cold. This book is about the labyrinthine pathways of our mind which treacherously conceal our most terrifying memories and how our subconscious prods us to replace the unpleasant truths with self-justifying falsities and even establishes our faith in them. It is about the seemingly innocuous, small cruelties of mundane everyday life that are capable of triggering much bigger disasters that destroy the lives of children and the unforgivable cruelties oblivious, ignorant children are themselves capable of.I refuse to label this electrifying debut novel mere crime fiction because, in all earnestness, it is not. Rather, it is literature which delves deep into the causality of crime and meticulously brings out the humanity of all the people involved, literature capable of wringing out empathy from even the least sensitive reader. And it is an exploration of the convoluted workings of the human mind, of evil and barbaric urges lurking somewhere in its darkest nooks and crevices. It is a cerebral suspense thriller and, without a doubt, one of the best I have ever read. But it is also a beautiful, bittersweet story about people who carry on with their broken lives shouldering the unbearable burden of past trauma, an unforgettable human drama which left me emotionally drained, agitated to the extreme and yet gasping for more."}, {"Review": "I started this series out of chronological order, which only increased my appreciation for French. By some odd chance, I happened upon a new copy of her second book, The Likeness, in the library just waiting to be checked out, while In the Woods had a wait list of at least 100 people. I followed with Faithful Place, immersed myself in Ireland of forty years ago and promptly forgot to get on the waiting list for Woods. Nataliya's lovely review reminded me what I was missing (here: http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/...)For a first book, Woods is impressive, not only because French takes risks with her narrative. It's a psychological mystery, an exploration of friendship and a slow disintegration of personality. I loved it, even as I dreaded the direction of the story. In brief, Rob Ryan is a detective on Dublin's Murder Squad. One day, the squad gets its first woman detective, Cassie Maddox. The two have an instant attraction and immediately begin a deep friendship. They happen to catch a case in which a 12 year-old girl is found murdered at an archeological dig, right where a highway exchange is supposed to be built (shades of Arthur Dent that I half-heartedly tried to ignore). Perhaps completely coincidentally, it is in the same small suburb that Ryan's two childhood friends disappeared when they were twelve. Ryan himself has no memory of the incident, and very few memories of the times after, but the case brings bits flashing back.What a challenge! Ryan tells us from the start: \"What I am telling you, before you begin my story, is this--two things: I crave truth. And I lie.\" Is our narrator unreliable? Or not? The outright acknowledgement that he might not be kept me guessing. At first, I loved his narrative voice. Descriptions of himself and his two twelve-year-old friends, 'Jamie,' and Peter, reminded me indelibly of Bradbury's Something Wicked This Way Comes and the gold-edged memories of summer days and best friends. Ryan captures some of that lost intimacy with Cassie, and it seems almost the first time since then that he has re-connected with another person. His voice had me chuckling with humor and sighing at his cynicism (see my numerous updates while I was getting my car's oil changed). Then oh-so-slowly the voice changed, subtly, distractedly. I won't say too much more except that it was extremely well done (view spoiler)[ and the character I loved at the beginning, I almost hated by the end. Not that he would have cared; he hated himself too.  (hide spoiler)]I love French's writing; the vivid descriptions, the integration of memories into narrative and her character development of her primary characters. Perhaps it fell apart a little at the end, and the red herrings weren't developed enough to be seriously considered. It felt a little more hurried after the slow pace of the beginning, but these are minor quibbles.The finish was stunning, if by 'stunning,' you mean a slap to the face right after someone answers your questions. Although I never deliberately avoid spoilers, for some reason I had not read any reviews before starting Woods that discussed various issues with the ending. Somewhat discombobulated, I went looking around for insight into French's process, and why she choose to do what she did. Interesting interview: http://www.dreamindemon.com/2009/01/0... Yep, definitely kept me thinking after I closed the pages. But also while I read them. Highly recommended.Cross posted at http://clsiewert.wordpress.com/2012/1..."}, {"Review": "3,5\ud83c\udf1fA cover for Lithuanian edition. Creepy, IKR! \ud83d\ude31I must thank two of my GR friends, Ginger and Michael, for turning my attention to this peculiar book! Thanks, guys \ud83d\ude09\ud83d\udc9cInteresting plot with mysteries and stuff.The story started off very well, with funny bits, conversations and I was hooked in from the very beginning. The first person narrative really helped and I liked following Rob Ryan in his investigation, he made me a partner and I love it in my detective reads. The grim and real police work, the dead-ends, the annoying bureaucracy and the final countdown when you reach the very essence of the story. Smooth and gripping, huh? Well, it wasn\u2019t so all the time. The first two fourths of the story were really interesting to read, because the writing is very detailed and expresses a well-built mystery, the pages just flew upon my eyes. The description of the places, surroundings is gripping and simply charming, I liked the common people there, with their ordinary life, was disturbed by their dark side. The atmosphere in dark moments was really effective enough to inspire horror and keep me wondering, what is there between the fa\u00e7ade of this place. I mentioned a problem with smoothness and I stumbled upon it when reaching the \u00be of the book. The plot is really gripping but I lost the pull when the main character decided that it\u2019s more \u201cinteresting\u201d to whine endlessly, bathing in self-loathing while I really REALLY wanted to know what happened further in the investigation. It just dragged the story into long and a bit boring phase with lots of eye-rolling for me. But to my great joy, this changed when I reached to the final part of the book. Memorable characters I can root for(or hate a lot!).The story centers upon two colleagues and best friends at the same time, they supplement each other, they are interesting and fun to observe. Until\u2026..until one of them decides to play the drama queen for too long! Oh, I know what you\u2019d say: \u2018But this character experienced so much trouble in the past!\u2019 I understand it, but it doesn\u2019t leave the right to hurt another character who experienced some psychological harm, too. Moreover, knowing it and being a total selfish bastard with a friend who\u2019s closest to you! (view spoiler)[Yes, Rob, you asshole, you deserved to be alone and see Cassie happy without you! \ud83d\ude24 And that\u2019s where I am stunned in a good way. Other authors could have played it safely with a nice HEA between Rob and Cassie as a couple. I marvel the author for this but it doesn\u2019t mean that I like it. Mainly because it\u2019s not fair and the friendship and partnership I was in awe for.., well, it\u2019s gone\u2026. (hide spoiler)]Remembering all the characters, I think that the author did a great job, they are well fleshed-out and complicated personalities with strengths and weaknesses. Some may look minor and unnecessary but it\u2019s def not so, they all have a place in making this book outstanding and move the story forward. I loved the psychological study of the human character there a lot, the sneak peeks into psychopath\u2019s mind and the awesome mind of the person who sees it and cracks the mysteries open! It\u2019s a gem in this book. And her name is Cassie \ud83d\udc9cSome fun parts from the book \ud83d\ude09\nCassie moved her stuff to the desk beside mine, and Costello got stuck with Quigley and gave us sad reproachful looks for weeks, like a martyred Labrador.\n\n\u201cI think I\u2019ll transfer somewhere nice and peaceful, like ERU,\u201d I said.\u201cERU needs fast response times, sweetie,\u201d Cassie said. \u201cIf it takes you half an hour to decide what to do with an imaginary worm, they\u2019re not gonna want you in charge of hostages.\u201dAt that point O\u2019Kelly banged into the squad room and demanded, \u201cWhere is everyone?\u201d Cassie hit Alt-Tab fast; one of her worms was named O\u2019Smelly and she had been purposefully sending him into hopeless situations, to watch him get blown up by exploding sheep.\nAll in all, this book is not a happy story, but it is a gripping read with suspense, interesting detective spices, peculiar and mostly charming character development, disturbing insight into what\u2019s behind the nice surface of the ordinary life. Not sure if I continue with the series, but we'll see \ud83d\ude09"}, {"Review": "When a twelve year old girl is found murdered at an archaeological dig, Detective Ryan and Maddox are on the case. But what does this case have to do with a similar case twenty years earlier, a case that saw an adolescent Ryan as the only survivor?As a veteran of detective fiction, riddles, and brain teasers, I'm a big fan of mysteries that keep me guessing. In the Woods was one of those sorts of mysteries.In the Woods is the story of two detectives looking for answers, both on the case they're working and inside themselves. Rob Ryan and Cassie Maddox are partners and best friends on the Dublin Murder Squad, detectives who catch all the murders that come down the pipe. When Katy Devlin is found murdered and sexually assaulted, they find themselves in the soup pretty quickly. Complicating things is the fact that Rob Ryan used to be Adam Ryan, a lad whose friends disappeared one afternoon, their bodies never found.In the Woods is very well written and it could be read as simply a police procedural, and it would have been a very good one. The thing that sets it apart from most run of the mill books of this type are the main characters. Rob and Cassie are very well written, real to the point that I wanted to shout at them a few times. Even though it took place in Dublin, it kind of reminded me of The Wire in that there was no happily ever after ending and no action. It was all gritty police work and even grittier interpersonal stuff.The mystery itself was solveable. Hell, the clues were even pointed out but I was too busy getting misdirected by French's skills. When the truth behind Katy's death was revealed, it was even more chilling than I'd imagined.(view spoiler)[French really saw me coming when the Ryan-Maddox relationship took a turn. I wanted them to get together and have detective babies, not have their world come crashing down! Why do you have to be so mean, French? Why? (hide spoiler)]Great, great book. I wouldn't say it was the best book I read in 2014 but it's definitely in the top ten. Tana French can lead me In The Woods any day. 4.5 out of 5."}, {"Review": "A very well-constructed and impressive debut novel. I had a bittersweet moment near the end when I realized that my theory from near the start of the book was correct; happy to be right, but also a bit bummed that I had figured it out. It wasn't much of a twist for me, but I honestly don't know how I solved it so early on. Don't let that keep you from reading this book. There were still quite a few surprising moments that didn't deal directly with the mystery, and those were incredibly satisfying. It really is a great novel\u2014a mystery with many layers, characters with depth, and beautiful writing. 4.5 stars"}, {"Review": "I've heard about readers who become so absorbed in a good book that they stay up late to finish them, or talk to the characters, or turn the pages hoping that something bad doesn't happen to them. I rarely if ever have reading experiences that primal; I'm usually analyzing the character development, narrative, even the margins and the design of the book, all from a safe remove, sort of like a naturalist perched in a camouflaged blind, studying.In the Woods, Tana French's debut novel which launched her \"Dublin Murder Squad\" series in 2007, knocked me out of my observation post with the locomotive power and cunning of a rhinoceros, or maybe a wild boar. French had me scrambling around the canopy and for 429 pages, never let up. The relentlessness of her novel is not due to cop thriller cliffhangers but the relationship she crafts between her two detectives, as well as their environment.Chapter 1 begins with a perfect sentence: What I warn you to remember is that I am a detective. The narrator is Robert Ryan, a competent if aloof young detective with the \"Murder Squad.\" He has a secret only five others know: Rob was born Adam Ryan and on August 14, 1984, while playing in the woods of Knocknaree in County Dublin, disappeared with his friends Peter Savage and Germaine \"Jamie\" Rowan. Adam was found that night clutching a tree, slashes on the back of his shirt and someone's blood pooled in his shoes. Neither Peter or Jamie were ever seen again. Adam, who was soon sent to boarding school in London and started going by his middle name \"Rob,\" has been unable to recall what happened that day. Rob joined the police to become a Murder detective and as a rookie, is briefly partnered with \"this cretin called Quigley, who sounded like Daffy Duck with a Donegal accent.\" This changes with the arrival of Cassie Maddox, the only woman on the squad and the fifth in its history. Rob rescues her from the rain and a malfunctioning Vespa one evening and the two become inseparable. Having fueled intense speculation among the men, Cassie confides to Rob that her rapid promotion was the result of being stabbed working in the UCD, not because she blew her cover, but because the campus drug dealer whose trust she gained became paranoid she was trying to take over his business.Despite token resistance by their superintendent O'Kelly against pairing up two rookies, Maddox & Ryan become partners and for the next couple of years, the partnership is bliss.Contrary to appearances, Cassie is not a particularly social person, any more than I am: she is vivacious and quick with banter and can talk to anyone, but given the choice, she preferred my company to that of a big group. I slept on her sofa a lot. Our solve rate was good and rising: O'Kelly stopped threatening to split us up every time we were late turning in paperwork. Sam O'Neill drew a deft little caricature of the two of us as Mulder and Scully (I still have it, somewhere) and Cassie stuck it to the side of her computer, next to a bumper sticker that said BAD COP! NO DOUGHNUT!Cassie & Rob are goofing off at work playing Worms on her office computer when O'Kelly enters the squad room. Archaeologists at a dig in the country where a new motorway is scheduled to be constructed have found the body of a young female. Cassie volunteers to take the case before O'Kelly adds that it's in Knocknaree. Cassie is the only cop who knows about Rob's past, but he assures his partner that he's all right, even though he hasn't returned to the woods of his childhood trauma since the summer of '84.The area around Knocknaree has been inhabited more or less since the Stone Age, with a Neolithic settlement and a Bronze Age ceremonial stone among the historical sites which will soon be rendered to history by the motorway. The victim was found on the ceremonial stone, her skull caved in and ligature marks on her neck. Fully dressed, she appears to have been raped. Maddox & Ryan interview the site director, Dr. Hunt, his research assistant Mark and a few of the student volunteers, including Damien, the badly shaken boy who discovered the body. One of the students identifies the victim: Katharine Devlin, aged 12, missing from the estates near the dig. Maddox & Ryan notify her family and Rob notices several things that bother him: Jonathan and Margaret Devlin don't touch throughout the interview. No neighbors stop by to console them. The surviving daughters, Rosalind (18) and Jessica (12) act much older or much younger than their respective ages. Katy was a local star, a dancer headed to the Royal Ballet School. Her father has launched a community drive seeking to redirect the motorway around the historical sites and has received threatening phone calls. With the possibility that someone who has a financial stake in the motorway killed Katy, Maddox & Ryan are given a partner, Sam O'Neill, a straight-shooter whose uncle is a mid-level minister and has contacts in the shady world of Irish county councils. Once Cassie determines that their killer had to be local, the pair also have to consider their case is related to the 1984 disappearances which Rob has redacted from his memory. He considers revealing his identity to O'Kelly and taking himself off the case, but feels driven to solve Katy's murder, whether or not he's ever able to journey back into the events of his youth and find answers.If In the Woods had been subtitled \"New York Murder Squad\" or \"San Francisco Murder Squad,\" it's doubtful I'd have picked the book up, but Tana French, an American who's resided in Dublin since 1990, tests a theory of mine: even the most strip mined sub-genre can have life breathed into it by relocating the story to a different country or era. A mob story set in New Jersey does not interest me. I've seen it. A mob story set in South Africa has my attention, as does a mob story set in 1880s New Jersey. Anyone who's always wanted to travel to Dublin can do no worse than this novel in terms of atmosphere. We work on the grounds of Dublin Castle, and it spite of all the colonial connotations this is one of my favorite perks of the job. Inside, the rooms have been lovingly refurbished to be exactly like every corporate office in the country--cubicles, fluorescent lighting, staticky carpet and institution-colored walls--but the outsides of the buildings are protected and still intact: old, ornate red brick and marble, with battlements and turrets and worn carvings of saints in unexpected places. In winter, on foggy evenings, crossing the cobblestones is like walking through Dickens--hazy gold streetlamps, throwing odd-angled shadows, bells pealing in the cathedral nearby, every footstep ricocheting into darkness; Cassie says you can pretend you're Inspector Abberline working on the Ripper murders.French's prose sings with brevity and detail, wit and mystique. She's not above dropping the occasional pop culture reference, whether to Stephen King or Law & Order, which dates her clearly as someone from my generation, the TV Generation, which I appreciated. French's observations and asides on the suspects Maddox & Ryan interview cut glass, and frequently turned my cheeks into a grin. For a novel set in Dublin, though, she almost completely does away with the regional patois that makes an author like Roddy Doyle something of a linguistics project for an American.After presenting an abundance of suspects and motives -- Cassie even considers, privately, that our unreliable narrator Detective Ryan could be responsible -- I was sufficiently caught off guard and completely enamored by the reveal of the killer. I don't read enough mysteries to make a sport out of Guessed It/ Didn't Guess It and can't say the reveal will surprise everyone who picks up this book, but I was practically doing cartwheels over the way French spins the climax, which I found to be more exciting than The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, for example.In the Woods is one of the best novels I've read so far. My ardor has little to do with killers or murder weapons or plot diagrams; it's the way French builds the relationship between Cassie Maddox and Rob Ryan. She echoes something I've read Lorne Michaels state on the nature of friendships: when we meet someone, we get a finite amount of time with them, which we can use up in a short period, or spend over a lifetime. I've had intense friendships that burned up and it was with melancholy and heartbreaking realization that I saw Cassie & Rob headed in that direction.(view spoiler)[If the only problem had been the fact that we couldn't bear to be in the same room, she would have found a new partner and dug in her heels, shown up for work a little thinner and more defiant every day, until we came up with a new way to be around each other or until I put in for a transfer. She was always the stubborn one, of us two. I think she transferred because she had lied to O'Kelly and she had lied to Rosalind Devlin, and both of them had believed her; and because, when she told me the truth, I had called her a liar.\n(hide spoiler)]Damn you, Tana French! I don't even have a box of tissue paper and if there's one thing worse than getting emotional over a novel, it's getting emotional with toilet paper to dry your eyes with. Dublin Murder Squad has currently spawned four sequels, beginning with The Likeness. On the basis of French's debut, I can't see getting around to Hemingway or Fitzgerald until I read everything she's written. "}, {"Review": "As seen on The ReadventurerIn the Woods reminded me a lot of Gillian Flynn's novels (Sharp Objects and Dark Places). All these books are very dark mysteries/psychological thrillers and they all are as much about particular crimes the narrators investigate as they are about the narrators themselves, a disturbed bunch.Rob Ryan, a detective on the Dublin Murder squad, and his partner Cassie Maddox are assigned to investigate a murder of a pre-teen girl. The thing is, the girl's body is found in the same woods where 20 years prior Rob's two best childhood friends disappeared. Rob undoubtedly witnessed their disappearance but has absolutely no recollection of what actually happened. Are these two crimes connected? Will investigating this new crime stir Rob's repressed memories? Is it a good idea at all for Rob to be involved in this case?In the Woods is a very strong debut novel. Although a little too wordy in places, it is still a beautifully written, skillfully constructed mystery, with a multitude of red herrings. But my favorite part of this book was witnessing the effect of the investigation on the detectives working on it. It almost destroys all people involved. And our narrator, Rob, is a very special head case. His transformation is particularly striking. I found the entire story very satisfying in terms of crime-solving. I was pleasantly surprised by how neatly French wrapped things up. Well, except that one huge piece of the puzzle that apparently infuriated a bunch of readers (not me though). That bit of unfinished business will have me coming back for more Tana French's novels."}, {"Review": "4.5\u2605\u201cWhat I am telling you, before you begin my story, is this\u2014two things: I crave truth.

But he can\u2019t bring himself to talk about it Cassie, which is unusual for them.This is the cloud that hangs over his part in the investigation. Katy\u2019s body was found on an archaeological dig site bordering the woods. One of the adults involved in the case was a troublesome youth when Adam/Rob was a boy, but he doesn\u2019t make the connection immediately. When he does, this sends his mind off in another direction in the past.They begin by investigating all of the people on the dig site and the family. Katy\u2019s father, has been leading an active protest group trying to preserve the site and stop the motorway that\u2019s about to demolish it. Was her murder a warning to him? What\u2019s the motive for someone murdering a child?When he\u2019s alone, Ryan remembers the fun he and his friends had as children in the woods and then has the occasional gut-wrenching flashback to what he does recall of the \u201cincident\u201d. But he keeps drawing a blank when it comes to details or of what happened to Jamie and Peter.The parts of the book I really enjoyed were the characters, the relationships, and the psychology that goes into investigating . . . and the sense of place. I realise the investigation is the reason for the story, but the author has a lot more to offer than a whodunit.Place.\u201cThe wood is all flicker and murmur and illusion. Its silence is a pointillist conspiracy of a million tiny noises\u2014rustles, flurries, nameless truncated shrieks; its emptiness teems with secret life, scurrying just beyond the corner of your eye.\u201dTruncated shrieks, secret life scurrying. Anyone who\u2019s spent time listening quietly in the bush will recognise how silent it sometimes isn\u2019t.\u201cIt was your basic Irish summer day, irritatingly coy, all sun and skidding clouds and jackknifing breeze, ready at any second to make an effortless leap into bucketing rain or blazing sun or both.\u201dI have to say that Aussies will tell you this is also true of Melbourne and the southern coasts of Australia. Heat from the inland deserts, ice from Antarctica, depending which way the wind\u2019s blowing. But I digress.Detectives:\u201cWhat I warn you to remember is that I am a detective. Our relationship with truth is fundamental but cracked, refracting confusingly like fragmented glass. It is the core of our careers, the endgame of every move we make, and we pursue it with strategies painstakingly constructed of lies and concealment and variation on deception.\u201dAs he said in the opening, he craves the truth, but he lies (to get it).Police partners:\u201cHow can I ever make you understand Cassie and me? . . . underlying everything we did, she was my partner. I don\u2019t know how to tell you what that word, even now, does to me; what it means. . . the power of putting your lives, simply and daily, into each other\u2019s hands.\u201dInterviewing kids:\u201cKids are unlikely to be frank about their siblings when their parents are around, and once a kid lies, especially a kid . . . young and confused . . . , the lie becomes fixed in his mind and the truth recedes to the background.\u201dWhy kids might wander off with someone, as explained by someone who did:\u201cI knew it was only a shed and he was only a groundskeeper, but at the same time I thought this might just be my chance to be one of the children who go through the wardrobe into the other world, and I couldn\u2019t stand the thought of spending the rest of my life knowing I\u2019d missed it.\u201dIt\u2019s a long book and a few slower patches kept it from quite hitting the five-star mark for me, but getting to know Rob and Cassie and Sam and the other characters made it well worth rounding up.I gather that French\u2019s Dublin Squad series can be read as stand-alone mysteries, but I\u2019ll be trying to find them in order."}, {"Review": "This is going to sound silly (this book did win the Edgar Award after all), but don\u2019t read this for the mystery. Although suitably disturbing, the murderer is fairly obvious. And, I won\u2019t lie to you \u2013 the phrase \u201cMunchausen by proxy\u201d is thrown around a few times. Also, there\u2019s the fact that the alternate title for this book could be: Complete and Utter Lack of Closure In The Woods. Don\u2019t read this if you need everything explained.Read this if you like to be consumed by a character \u2013 so consumed that you fall completely into his point of view. You\u2019ll be charmed initially by his witty humor and unfailing loyalty to his partner, Cassie. Eventually you may start to notice small lapses in his tale. You may notice that his word can\u2019t always be trusted. But by that point, it will already be too late. You\u2019ll already have fallen for him.Which is why you can really only experience this book once. This is my second time, and it\u2019s amazing just how differently everything appeared from my more elevated point of view. I knew the lay of the land and I knew what was coming (although that didn\u2019t stop me from hoping that everything would end differently this time around). I also knew just how wonderfully, compellingly limited this narrator really is and it was fascinating to see him with that in mind. It almost felt like being betrayed over and over again by someone I trusted.Even the mystery looked different this time around. After all, what\u2019s more creepy really \u2013 catching the killer and tying everything up in a neat little package, or knowing that even your own memories are suspect? Knowing that the murderers are still out there and may never be found or convicted? Knowing that you really don\u2019t know anything at all? That's why the woods themselves are so terrifying aren't they? Not because of what we know for sure goes on inside, but because of every horrible, monstrous thing that we we imagine goes on. The shapeless, nameless monsters that live inside our own imaginations will always be more terrifying than the real, definable ones. They have no limits.Don\u2019t read the sequel to this book for its mystery either \u2013 again, you\u2019ll be disappointed. Read it to find out how deluded the narrator of this book really was, and how much he lied to you. Read it to fall head over ankles into another utterly absorbing point of view."}, {"Review": "Now this is my kind of book. This is the best book I have read in a very long time! In the Woods has been languishing on my list forever, probably because it has mixed reviews. I am thankful I finally gave it a shot. Tana French writes beautifully, but in a way that does not hinder the flow of the story. The protagonist, young Irish cop Rob Ryan, tells the story in retrospect. This is done subtly with real-time Rob interjecting only sporadically until the end when he directly delivers the epilogue. I found this technique unique and refreshing. Ms. French pens a stunningly good character study in this novel, presenting her protagonist with profound depth, warts and all. Despite him bringing much of his misery onto himself, my heart couldn\u2019t help but break for him over the last third of the book as he struggled to make sense of what was happening. I haven\u2019t felt that invested in a character in a long while. Though I did not love Rob as much as I love Angela Marsons\u2019 Kim Stone or Cody McFadyen\u2019s Smoky Barrett, my emotions were every bit as wrapped up in him. I know I will never forget Rob Ryan.Ms. French writes her characters with a great deal of psychological overlay. I looked up her \u201ccredentials\u201d and was shocked to find she does not have a background in psychology. Yes, she is that good. For readers who are interested in a quickly-paced, plot-driven mystery, you won\u2019t find it here. This is a real slow burner, but one that kept me enthralled. The crime plot consists of two threads, one that took place over twenty years previous to the other. Are these events connected? This is a big question. Many readers who did not give the book a good rating had issues relating to a singular loose end in the plot. I usually don\u2019t care for significant loose ends either, but I had no problem with the way this particular story evolved. The ending was true to the character of Rob Ryan; anything else would have been Hollywood. All the other issues were wrapped up beautifully.I think Tana French writes masterfully. She has quickly risen to \u201cmust read everything\u201d prominence on my to-read list. I strongly recommend In the Woods to everyone interested in a hauntingly compelling, character-driven, slow burner of a story. 5 ++++ stars."}, {"Review": "Adam Ryan is a pretty compact, if cool name. That's the name of our main protagonist. His trials are deep, both when he was a boy, and also when he is working in the police force.From the point of view of a reader who has read the books in disorder, there are many ah moments. I remember future events with clarity and purpose. This book must have demanded a lot from its author.I say that because it's not easy to pry open the genie in the bottle and ask for inspiration as a favor. Tana French is not that elderly, yet her hand is assured and I suspect she never ails from writer's block. I want to join NaNoWriMo when I read books like this."}, {"Review": "\nWhat I am telling you, before you begin my story, is this - two things: I crave truth. And I lie.\n4.5 starsIf I ever hear anyone say that murder mysteries are never well-written or literary I will shove this book in their face. I devoured this rather large gem within a couple days and found myself thinking about it long after I had finished.I can see how this book will only be enjoyed by a certain type of reader. If you\u2019re annoyed by metaphors, similes and other literary devices or don\u2019t like wordy books, this one isn\u2019t for you. If you\u2019re a reader who needs everything resolved and explained in the end, this one isn\u2019t for you either. But if you enjoy psychological thrillers with messed up characters, absolutely pick this up.The story follows Rob Ryan, a detective in the Dublin Murder Squad. He is assigned to solve the murder case of a 12-year-old ballet dancer together with his partner and friend, Cassie Maddox. What his supervisors don\u2019t know however, is that the case hits a bit too close to home for Rob: twenty years earlier two kids disappeared in those same woods where the young girl was murdered, two kids who coincidentally happened to be Rob\u2019s best childhood friends. We watch as the cases (both the old and the new) unfold before us, dragging up unwanted memories and causing the detectives to slowly deteriorate and become increasingly on edge as one dead end after another presents itself. In the Woods is not simply a murder mystery. It is a study of characters, a deeply insightful story about people and their reasons for acting the way they do, a look at love, loss, friendship, memory and so much more. The characters were so wonderfully palpable and authentic that I felt like they were in the room with me, like they were real people going about their daily lives. Tana French draws detailed and nuanced portraits of her characters that you cannot help but feel empathy for. This is also what makes this book so painful to read at times. I both loved and hated Rob Ryan. Loved because at heart he is a good person who doesn\u2019t do things out of spite, but simply because he is lost and doesn\u2019t know any better. Hated because he is so flawed and does so many things wrong that I just wanted to slap him most of the time. Ultimately though, I came to care for him a great deal and didn\u2019t want anything bad to happen to him, I just wished him happiness.\nI am not good at noticing when I'm happy, except in retrospect.\nCassie on the other hand, I just loved. I found her to be such an empowering female character: dynamic and full of life, witty and intelligent, kind yet not na\u00efve.For me the best thing about this book (and I would argue for most readers) is the friendship between Rob and Cassie. It\u2019s so freaking wonderful. The kind of friendship everyone dreams of but most will never find. A way of understanding the other person without words, to know what they need when they need it, to want to sacrifice your own happiness for the other. It filled me with a sense of nostalgia, of longing, and made this book so touching without even trying.\nIf she had hurt me, I could have forgiven her without even having to think about it; but I couldn't forgive her for being hurt.\nAnd then there is the writing. That gorgeous mix of stunning prose and hilarious wit that made the book not only an entertaining read but a deep one as well. The novel was filled with little philosophically and psychologically stimulating snippets and I loved that aspect of the book so much. How Tana French managed to interweave her wordier writing style with a fast-paced mystery is truly masterful and I immediately felt in good hands once I had started the book.The mystery itself was engaging and perfectly paced. I loved how Tana French planted so many red herrings and introduced different characters to constantly keep the reader on his toes. However, I did guess who the person behind the murder was relatively quickly and this is also the reason I\u2019m not giving this book five stars. Additionally, some of the explanations were a bit convenient. Having said that though, it really didn\u2019t majorly impact my reading experience since this book is more about the characters than just the plot.The ending frustrated many people and I can definitely see why, but I really liked it. There are couple of things you could have issues with: (view spoiler)[what happened between Cassie and Rob left me heartbroken but was also strangely fitting, the fact that the mystery of the disappearance of Rob\u2019s childhood friends wasn\u2019t solved (which was fine with me) and the frustration that Rosalind wasn\u2019t punished (infuriating but realistic). (hide spoiler)]Overall, I loved this book and highly recommend it. It left me with a hollow feeling after finishing it and I cannot wait to read the second instalment (which I\u2019ve already bought). If you\u2019re in the mood for a good mystery/thriller, definitely give this a try."}, {"Review": "Well, at the beginning I thought this book would be five stars. An intriguing premise: a great opening: beautiful evocative language that you usually don't see in a mystery. The story also had great characterisation and moved at just the right pace.Then, about 80% into the story at the time of the great revelation, everything went phut! for me.Adam \"Rob\" Ryan is part of the Dublin Murder Squad. He is partnered with Cassie Maddox, a resourceful female detective. Rob Ryan harbours a secret: he is Adam Ryan, one of the three children who disappeared into the woods at Knockaree twenty years ago - the only one who returned. When he came back, little Adam had no memory of the incident, and his shoes are filled with somebody else's blood. When young Katy Devlin is found murdered at the same site, the old ghosts come back to haunt Rob. He is sure that the murder is connected with his childhood trauma in some way - and the investigation becomes a journey into his past too.Don't get me wrong. This is a good mystery, with a plausible story-line and no plot holes to speak of (except one - how did Rob manage to hide his past from his department?) in addition to all the plus points I mentioned in the first paragraph. But three huge defects (IMO) pulled it down to three stars for me.One: (view spoiler)[The author cheats with the intro: while making us believe that this story is somehow connected integrally with Adam Ryan's past, we realise at the end that this was nothing but a McGuffin to end all McGuffins! The old mystery is never explained, even though tantalising snippets are provided throughout the narrative that would have us believe that the explanation is just around the corner. While this kind of open ending is admissible in a literary novel, it is totally unacceptable in a mystery. (hide spoiler)]Two: The protagonist is totally unlikeable. Yeah, I know that he had a screwed up childhood, but going through such long story with only his dark thoughts for company was not an enjoyable experience to say the least.Three: I saw through the mystery - at least part of it - and I think any perceptive reader will. (view spoiler)[Rosalind's manipulative tactics were so evident that I wanted to punch Ryan in the mouth for being taken in by her wiles. Call himself a detective? (hide spoiler)]However, I still think this is an enjoyable mystery worth a read."}], "Genre": "Crime", "ID": "2459785", "Desc": ""}
