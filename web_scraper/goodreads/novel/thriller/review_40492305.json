His books featuring \"retired\" hitman John Rain, and his newer books featuring troubled sex crimes detective Livia Lone are fantastic, but this one really hits a home run. Way to get my heart pounding!Livia is leading the Seattle Police Department's involvement with the FBI in a joint investigation of a child pornography ring when she and a consultant discover that there are some pretty influential people caught in this horrible, tangled web. But as Livia searches to identify the culprits, the investigation is quickly shut down.Of course, Livia is not one to be easily dissuaded\u2014until she finds herself the target of an attempt on her life. If it weren't for her police-sharpened instincts and her martial arts skills, she probably would have been killed, but instead, you should see the other guys. Still, it doesn't take an investigative genius to know that she has stirred up a hornet's nest, and it's one that is going to get infinitely more dangerous if she doesn't drop the matter. And the likelihood of Livia walking away from children being put in the worst kind of danger is nil.Ironically, the hit on Livia, along with two other people, was originally offered to John Rain, who refused, both on principle (he never kills women) and because he didn't like the attitude of the person trying to hire him. This refusal proves to be a bit dangerous for him and two former colleagues who connected him with the potential customer. Suddenly Rain's retirement looks to be a thing of the past, as he tries to figure out what is behind all of the violence.When Livia calls on former Marine sniper (and Rain's best friend) Dox for help out of her predicament, he turns to Rain. It doesn't take long before they've essentially created a squad of highly trained killers to try and go after the mastermind of the whole circle of violence. In addition to Rain, Dox, and Livia, there's Rain\u2019s estranged lover (and Mossad agent) Delilah, lethal black ops soldier Daniel Larison, and their former commander, Colonel Scot \u201cHort\u201d Horton. No one should want to cross this group\u2014but they know all too well someone will, soon enough.The race to kill before being killed, and capture the person behind the hit on Livia and the squelching of the child pornography investigation takes the group across the world, before everything explodes in Paris. Lives are at stake, but so are some complex emotions\u2014love, anger, fear, loyalty, betrayal, and revenge.The Killer Collective meshes together Rain, Livia, and characters from Eisler's previous books so well. While there are references to previous books, even I didn't read some of them, and yet I didn't find that a problem at all. Not only is there some fantastic action, double-crosses, and impressive weaponry, but Eisler doesn't just give you stock characters\u2014these are complex characters with layers of emotional baggage and, in some cases, long-standing friendships and relationships. This makes the book so much richer.The book takes a little time to build up momentum as it sets everything up, but once it does...boom! There was just so much to like about this book, the same way I've felt about every one of Eisler's books I've read through the years. For me, having Rain, Dox, and Delilah together felt like dropping in on old friends, and adding Livia to the mix added to the book's complexity and emotion.Essentially, Eisler has created a more literary version of The Expendables\u2014that movie series that brought together Stallone, Schwarzenegger, Jet Li, Chuck Norris, Jason Statham, Dolph Lundgren, Bruce Willis, and other action heroes.Amazon First Reads and Thomas & Mercer provided me an advance copy of the book in exchange for an unbiased review.

Here was a character of integrity I could totally get behind.Then there was the pairing of Livia and Dox/Carl, the charismatic Texan sniper, which was genius. Who doesn't love to laugh with and at good ole Dox? Apparently even Livia gets this big oaf's charm and is uniquely qualified to understand his \"je ne sais quoi\".But I spent the last two books in the Livia Lone series aching to get a glimpse of John Rain. Yeah, yeah, he's retired from \"the life\", but surely we can't keep him away from all the fun in another kill-before-you're-killed race against (yet again) both time and sickeningly powerful men.\"Is this what you call retirement? Danger and intrigue and killing?\"In The Killer Collective, John finally arrives, collected together with all my favorite major players from Eisler's world of vigilante justice and contract killing. YES, THE WHOLE GANG IS FINALLY TOGETHER.This time our endearingly damaged, but highly effective, collection of misfits bands together to tackle a particularly vile group of US government employees indulging in the child sex ring, Hurtcore. Just like with the Nazis, it's hard to find someone who wouldn't be willing to step up to out anyone participating in such an evil and disturbing global organization, one that violently damages children physically and breaks them emotionally to get their jollies. (A quick Google shows this is no fabrication on Eisler's part. Hurtcore is real and even more nefarious than he lets on. Props to the author for not indulging in details, because these pedophiles are sicker than sick. If only OUR world had the powerhouse of Rain-Livia-Dox and The Killer Collective to take down these darkweb deviants in real life.)I can never get enough of the nonstop action that always finds John Rain, Dox, Livia, Delilah and the rest of these noble badasses. If these books ever stop, I don't know what I'll do, except reread myself silly through the series again and again. And again. But there was enough foreshadowing at the end to assure me there will certainly be a Livia Lone #4. My money says it'll be called, or at least themed, \"The Reckoning\". Bad guys beware -- retaliate against Livia and she will most certainly take you DOWN."}, {"Review": "John Rain is a hitman offered a job targeting three individuals. He turns down the job, but is swept up in the action when one of the targets, Livia Lone, survives the attempted hit. Not only is John involved, but so are various others with connections to Rain and Livia.Told using alternating points of view, this novel has a lot of characters and multiple storylines. Even though there was a lot going on, it was easy to follow and everything was wrapped up by the end.This book is part of a series. Actually, it's part of multiple series by Barry Eisler. I didn't realize that when I picked it as my First Reads book this month, but, fortunately, it was easily read as a standalone. This is book 10 in the John Rain series, book 3 in the Livia Lone series, and book 4 in the Ben Treven series. John Rain is a \"retired\" hitman. Livia Lone is a sex crimes detective. Ben Treven is a black ops soldier. I'm sure readers of these series get more from the book than I did, since they would already be familiar with the backstories of the characters. Still, I found it to be a good, fast-paced read. I may look into the earlier books in these series.This thriller involves multiple government agencies. From Seattle PD to the FBI to the Secret Service. A fast-paced thriller with sex crimes, black ops, and multiple bad guys. Intriguing, complex, and exciting.This book was my pick for Amazon's First Reads in January 2019."}, {"Review": "\n\"The war to protect children from predators is a war everyone should fight.\"\nThis book includes the characters from this author's different series. I read only Livia Lone and she was my main point of interest in this story.Flove this woman - a real fighter!Strong female with a heart of gold. They showed the vulnerable part of her, but still with a backbone of steal.I respect the hell out if this author for touching the topic of child abuse with dignity and respect for victims, and telling the depth of disturbing network of the most disgusting human garbage - paedophiles. And for fighting for JUSTICE!The real action took place in the last 20%. But the investigation and planning was written excellent. I sincerely hope it's not the last book about Livia. This amazing woman is a person our world needs more and more!!!\n\"Protecting people who can\u2019t protect themselves. It\u2019s .\u00a0.\u00a0. a big deal for me.\"\nDon't miss the notes at the end, freaking incredible the work this author done. This book is what I call literature. Deep, raw, thoroughly researched and intelligently written.\n\"The war to protect children from predators is a war everyone should fight.\"\n\n\"The war to protect children from predators is a war EVERYONE should fight.\"\n\n\"The war to protect children from predators is a war EVERYONE SHOULD FIGHT.\"\n"}, {"Review": "My review of The Killer Collective can be found at High Fever Books.Ever since Barry Eisler\u2019s newest series character Liva Lone appeared on the scene in her eponymous 2016 debut, I was waiting for the day she would cross paths with the author\u2019s original creation, John Rain. Finally, that day has come, and the two \u2014 along with their many and various colleagues \u2014 share page space in The Killer Collective. Like Eisler\u2019s 2011 novel, The Detatchment, The Killer Collective brings together all of the various characters he\u2019s written about over the years, Avengers-style. As such, this book wears a lot of hats and its characters have their own already-deeply established relationships and web of networks. The Killer Collective is the tenth John Rain thriller, the third in Livia Lone\u2019s series, and the fourth Ben Treven book. Although Eisler gives enough information about each of these characters and their histories to make this an accessible introduction for new readers, long-time fans will likely find a lot more to appreciate given their built-in familiarity with the diverse and storied cast after having come to know all the different faces here over the last couple decades.While investigating a child sex abuse ring Livia uncovers connections to several Secret Service agents, which quickly makes her a target for assassination. Needing her death to look natural, John Rain is contacted through a cutout, but he refuses to kill women and children and turns down the job. The inquiry, though, is enough to pique his interest and draw him out of retirement in order to find more information on who attempted to hire him. Soon enough, he\u2019s drawn into Livia\u2019s orbit thanks to a mutual acquaintance, his friend Dox, who also partnered with Livia in The Night Trade.Given the large cast surrounding Livia and Rain, there isn\u2019t a lot of time to develop deep emotional connections between the reader and the characters. However, those who have been with Eisler and his creations for the long haul already know these operatives and assassins intimately. It\u2019s a handy shortcut to rely on, and it allows Eisler to focus hard on the action and keep the book moving at a rapid-fire pace.The Killer Collective moves hard and fast as Rain and his reassembled detachment go on the offensive to target those who have put them in the cross-hairs, and the action sequences are delightfully large-screen in their scope. Between helicopter attacks, pinpointing a sniper\u2019s den, and becoming embroiled in a massive shootout at a French bar, neither the reader nor the detachment have a lot of room in which to breath and slowing down isn\u2019t an option. While the book moves along a frenetic pace, Eisler\u2019s depiction of action and tactics is as sharp as ever. He cleanly portrays violence, letting you see every step of the assault, inside and out. The action is high and mighty violent, but also psychologically complex. He gets us into the heads of these operators as they stage an execution or prepare a counter-offensive assault, understanding the mental and emotional components to their physical actions, how it will make their targets feel instinctively and how those feelings can be further leveraged to achieve their goals. The characters are also deeply aware of their comrades subtexts, thanks in part to their long relationships or because of their own inclinations. As I said earlier, I\u2019d been waiting to see how Livia and Rain would get on, and in fact it\u2019s nicely subdued. Both recognize elements of themselves in the other and understand the natural boundaries that exist around them. They\u2019re damaged loners, but also deeply professional and aware of the deep, unspoken currents residing in the other\u2019s psyches, even if they don\u2019t know each others actual histories very well. Ultimately, their relationship is one built upon mutual respect, and I dug that aspect a lot. It\u2019s hard to say if they\u2019ll ever meet again, but as a one-off it\u2019s a satisfying exploration and the inciting elements that bring them together are nicely, chaotically staged.The Killer Collective is not as deeply emotional as prior books in Eisler\u2019s oeuvre, particularly the grueling debut of our latest series heroine in Livia Lone, but it does have plenty of other rewards and more than its fair share of thrills. And when it comes to staging and exploring violence from the head-space of trained killers, nobody does it better than Barry Eisler. The Killer Collective is an adrenaline-fueled marathon run of action and conspiracy from beginning to end, filled with plenty of combat and movie screen-ready violence that\u2019s more satisfying than ten of Hollywood\u2019s biggest summer blockbusters. Now\u2026when\u2019s the next one releasing?"}, {"Review": "New York Times bestselling author Barry Eisler (The Night Trade) merges his two most popular franchises in his latest action-packed thriller. This time around, Detective Livia Lone of the Seattle PD sex crimes unit has her eyes set on bringing down an evil child pornography ring. Because the ring has gone international, though, it\u2019s a federal case, and Lone is forced to partake in a joint investigation between the Seattle police department and the FBI.After making headway on the case, Lone is the victim of an assassination attempt, narrowly escaping with her life. Things take a turn, however, when she discovers that those behind the attempted hit may be linked to the FBI. Searching for help, Lone turns to former Marine sniper Dox, whom she partnered with in The Night Trade, and the duo realizes that someone tried to kill Lone in order to keep her from exposing a bigger conspiracy. Worse, the people she\u2019s after prove to be nearly unreachable and impossible to get to, though Lone isn\u2019t one to give up or shy away from such a challenge.As the story unfolds, it\u2019s revealed that retired hitman John Rain (The Zero Sum, 2017, etc.) previously turned down the job to take out Lone, paving the way for their paths to cross. Rain, an elite killer who specializes in making it appear as though his targets died of natural causes . . .

For me - having Rain, Dox, and Delilah together felt like seeing old friends, and adding Livia into the mix added to the book's complexity and emotion - as well as providing the impetus (based on real types of crimes) for the novel.There are references to several of Eisler's previous novels, but even if you didn't read some of them, it wouldn't be a problem. There is great action, impressive gadgetry and weaponry, intrigue, and romance. This book reminds me of a literary version of the Expendables, but deeper and with more heart!While I could go on about the specifics of the book, I won't. I wouldn't want to spoil anything for anyone. :)I will say that I would recommend this to pretty much anyone I know!"}, {"Review": "This was an Amazon First Reads pick, and I came into it cold, not having read any of the author's previous works. As such, I was confronted with a large ensemble cast about whom I had no back story or history, but despite this the book was easy to get into in its own right. I didn't feel like I was missing pieces, or not \"in on the joke\", and thoroughly enjoyed the pace, the action and the characters. It has, though, certainly made me want to backtrack and fill in the history.Like Michael Connelly, it seems Eisler has woven a \"universe\" for his intriguing and powerful characters to inhabit and, in some cases, interact. It seems this is not the first collaboration between some of them, but possibly the first where the full suite of protagonists come together at once. Each chapter is written from the perspective of one or other of the characters in the book (6 or 7 different voices, as far as I can recall), the only slightly unsettling aspect to this is that one of the characters is voiced in first-person whilst the rest of the book is third person. That took a little adjusting each time it moved into a \"Rain\" chapter, but not a big complaint.The action comes thick and fast from almost the very beginning of the book (putting aside the scene-setting prologue which leaves a lot of unanswered questions that stay that way until close to the end), and there is a lot of it, but the action scenes never get repetitive or \"samey\". This assures me that the author's previous works will be well worth visiting with the promise that they will not be repetitive or dull.The characters (all of them in one way or another) are powerful and interesting, it truly is an ensemble cast with a widely varied group, and the uneasy dynamic between them makes for a great level of drama and suspense beyond that provided by the actual plot. The plot itself unravels rapidly as the book goes on, but never runs out of steam, and doesn't fall into the common trap of exhausting itself before the climax. The good guys are suitably dark and morally questionable, and the bad guys are truly despicable. The global settings are well researched and used to great effect. Overall a great read which I went through at a fast pace (in my usual half-hour bite sized reading opportunities) because it kept me gripped throughout. Highly recommended, and I will definitely be going after Eisler's back catalogue."}, {"Review": "I don\u2019t normally read books like this, but thanks do NetGalley who provided an arc in exchange for honest review, I took a chance. Glad I did!This book follows a cast of characters through a high-octane, multi-region, high stakes suspense. There\u2019s Livia, a strong, female Seattle cop who works on sex crimes (in this one she\u2019s tracking down a child pornography ring). Rain, Horton and Larison are three unsavory, complicated, likable hit men. Some ansillary characters include Dox, Delilah, and Ben. No one knows who can be fully trusted (their pasts together are complicated). The plot is straightforward: secret service agents are suspected in trafficking child porn and a government contractor is put in place to clean up the mess (specifically take out the cop, a computer hacker working with her, and his FBI boss). Rain is contacted for the hit but he declines. Once the hit is laid, Livia contacts a friend, Dox, who\u2019s association pulls in the Killer Collective. There\u2019s a bunch of action from the get-go and despite the book being a series, one doesn\u2019t need to be familiar with the cast or the previous events to get sucked it. Another nice thing for me, one doesn\u2019t need to know military or CIA jargon either. It\u2019s a fun read, with interesting characters who shine despite (or maybe because...) flaws. Part cop noir part spy-like genre, there\u2019s enough in here to keep the pages turning. No real surprises but that\u2019s ok. Thanks to NetGalley who provided arc in exchange for honest review."}, {"Review": "EISLER is a skilled author that in this Killer Collective brings together main characters from his other series books. I have read all of the Livia Lone books and just love Dox! I have not read any of the John Rain books but he showed himself to be a complex character and no doubt why there are nine others in his series. \"A copy of this book was provided by Thomas and Mercer via Netgalley with no requirements for a review. Comments here are my honest opinion.\" A book that has both the Good Cop - -Bad Cop theme. Also mentioned his other book the God's EYE which I have read and loved."}, {"Review": "Not the worst book Eisler has written, but overall it\u2019s disappointing.Eisler wrote some very good paragraphs, some showing keen insight into the human condition. Ultimately, though, the book is tedious and simply goes on too long. Eisler, like many writers in the genre, goes to great lengths to establish credibility, such as providing detailed information on weapons and locations, but he fails to address, much less correct, fundamental issues such as the nature of his characters\u2019 work and their value as human beings. For example, Livia Lone is a Seattle police officer, albeit a murderous avenging angel. Why is she associating with hired killers and mercenaries? "}, {"Review": "I absolutely devoured this one, which is the tenth John Rain thriller, the third in the Livia Lone series, and the fourth Ben Treven outing. Like 2011's The Detatchment, Eisler, reminding us of \"The Avengers,\" brings together all of the different characters we've grown to love over the years. Each of the characters already has well established relationships and networks all over the world. It was both great fun and edge of your seat suspense. I disagree with the reviewer that complained of too much killing. Every one was fine with me, and most even expected, IMHO. The character of my recent favorite, Livia Lone, grows as we learn a bit more of how she operates. Can't wait for her next stand-alone. John Rain, a past favorite, isn't as much fun now that he has \"retired,\" but he's still the only one who gets to tell his part in the first person. The whole book is a treat for Eisler fans, but the last 15% of this one is truly edge of your seat stuff. There is a major and tragic shock in this ending, and it made me sad. But the loose ends are all tied up and we are left breathless but now looking for the next one. Eisler knows what he's doing and is one of the best. "}, {"Review": "I started out reading thrillers years ago through a book club where our first pick was THE GOLD COAST by Nelson Demille. I have continued enjoyed to enjoy the genre on a regular basis thanks to excellent writers and Megan Beatie of MB Communications who sends excellent novels for me to review. Author Barry Eisler has written many thriller series, but THE KILLER COLLECTIVE is a standalone book. It does have protagonists John Rain, Livia Lone and Ben Treven from earlier series. Livia Lone works for the Seattle Police and is involved with the FBI in investigating a child pornography ring. She is suddenly told it is being shut down. Livia is almost killed in a hit that has been offered to John Rain, who is retired, but has excelled in the field of killings that looked like normal accidental deaths.Livia gets in touch with Dox who is a former Marine sniper. They assemble a group of \"killers\" who try to get to the bottom of the ring which may involve the FBI and other government agencies. Although most thrillers are action driven, there is plenty of character development in THE KILLER COLLECTIVE and even some touches of humor and romance. The changes in locales are engaging and the end location of Paris is particularly charming and fun.Each chapter is plainly marked with a character's name and the third person point of view which helps to propel the narrative. My only criticism of this wonderful novel is I did have a trouble keeping all the people straight for a while since the author uses last names, first names and nicknames. By mid-way through I had everyone in place in my mind.Barry Eisler writes a truly authentic tales since he spent three years in covert operations. He is also well versed in international law since he has worked with a law firm with that specialty.Entertainment Weekly magazine has already picked THE KILLER COLLECTIVE as a must read thriller and lucky Kindle First readers have the novel as a January choice. I highly recommend it as thriller that will provide with exciting entertainment."}, {"Review": "This was a pretty ambitious project for author Barry Eisler since he weaved together most of the characters in his previous books into a seamless story line. I liked the Detachment which required him to do the same thing, but I thought he did it here much better, and with more characters to boot.Eisler sets the scene well from the very beginning by introducing one of the main villains from the first act. He quickly introduces him without making him cartoonish. He quickly establishes all of his previous characters in the book without letting any of them monopolize the entire book. A lot of his characters have grown since he last wrote about them and he establishes this too in a very economical way.There is also a lot of practical information in this book. I would highly recommend the bibliography. I was definitely happy that this was in Amazon's First Reads selection. Not that I won't be getting the physical book the second it comes out."}, {"Review": "I am loving this... no spoilers but... You know how irritating it is when a writer creates a memorable character, then a series, and you love every book. Then he stops and writes another series and you love that, and then he stops and writes another series. You get annoyed because you have to wait for a bit longer each time. (Sorry Barry - not really complaining). AND THEN ....He does this brilliant thing and puts them all in the same book. Much appreciated Mr Eisler - now to persuade the Robert B. Parker estate (and Reed Farrel Coleman to put Spenser, Hawk, Vinnie, Jesse Stone and Sonny Randall in the same book properly - best of all - make it a 500 pager you guys)"}, {"Review": "Not bad, but there is still just a bit too much casual killing in these series; maybe get a little more surgical in the next one? This one is the tried and true \u201cget the gang together\u201d plot device after Lone discovers something nefarious with Nat Sec dimensions while investigating a pedophile ring. For all the killing there is also a bit too much Serious Talk on the relationship side. There\u2019s a nice comic description of mansplaining in action though and some other good bits such as Delilah trapping the bad guy by his egoism. There\u2019s also a good Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s cat allusion - gets the theory right for a change. More of that.And as I\u2019ve said about 2000 times, if the bad guys would react with some subtlety, instead of just starting to kill people (blowing up an airliner!) they probably would get away with it. The Deep State didn\u2019t get where it is today by being stupid."}, {"Review": "Eisler just keeps getting better. As excited as I was to see Dox in Livia Lone's last installment, here we have all the major characters: Dox, Livia Lone, John Rain, Delilah, Larisen and Treven. It's a testament to Eisler's writing ability that with all these killers in one place, each voice is individual without relying on stereotypes to establish character. And for some reason, I found this book to be more lyrical. It's not just the Basho thrown in here and there, but the language Eisler uses balances out his tactical descriptions. Like in his novel, The Detachment, the characters have trouble developing trust, and in this case, it seems that some of the parties may actually be working against each other. There are plenty of explosions, shootings and chases to keep action/adventure readers happy, and I have to say, I did not see the final reveal coming. Well played, Mr. Eisler. Well played (slow clap). While this is a stand-alone and you don't need to read any other books first, I think reading Eisler's back catalog is helpful. There are even a couple of references to at least the two novellas I read about Delilah and Larisen, as well as to Livia's background and events in The Detachment. Like I said, not necessary, but it gives a more rounded picture. And as usual, I highly recommend you read this in electronic format. Eisler is a master of the endnote. His links to actual events that helped shape his narrative are both horrifying and invaluable."}, {"Review": "Excellent Rarely do I give five star reviews. The majority of my reading is purely my form of escape and I read virtually every day to relax and escape. I find so much repetition and narrowly focused plots in much of the published books today, and while entertaining, they lack in reality or creativity or are just another story about terrorists or some superman who kills everything.This book was creative and centered on theme not well used in today's typical action novels. The characters are quite diverse and the multi-faceted dramas interwoven throughout are interesting and add reality to the cast and plot. The use of more sophisticated language was delightful (had me using the dictionary several times) as it was not so burdensome that I felt like I was reading a technical manuel, but enough to entice me to expand my knowledge (which is a plus, considering reading fiction entirely for pleasure).So, Mr. Eisler,I shall be looking for more of your work. Thank you for an exceptional reading experience...and a bit of learning too."}, {"Review": "A great thriller that I liked for other reasons It is a terrific thriller, fast paced, never boring, with a plot that, though complicated, never caused me to feel lost. It was obviously well researched, and never did I get that feeling I get with some books, of, \u201coh, please!\u201d doubts.One reason I liked it so much is that the characters were well developed, three dimensional, with characteristics to both admire and not admire so much. In other words, they felt real.Another reason is the author\u2019s writing style. His prose is entertaining, and moving. I loved the way he created tension between Rain and Delilah, and then brought them together slowly in a thoroughly genuine and satisfying way.Lastly, the sex and violence, and vulgar language, wasn\u2019t celebrated; it was used as needed, when and where it made sense.I highly recommend this book, one of the very few I\u2019ve read that I have thoroughly enjoyed with no complaints, only compliments."}, {"Review": "Wow I could not put this book down!I was hooked from the first page and could not put the book down.Each character is described with just enough information for the reader to connect with that character and understand their thought process.Just enough details were given though out the book that allows the reader to develop a picture in their mind without over doing it.Lots of action, companionship, and even lost love.Ties up all lose ends at end of book.Really good book and look forward to reading more from this author.Highly recommend if you like fast paced page turners."}, {"Review": "PW Starred: In this crackling-good thriller from bestseller Eisler (The Night Trade), Seattle PD sex crimes detective Livia Lone, assassin John Rain, and former Marine sniper Dox form a testy alliance to combat a vile conspiracy involving corrupt and toxic government agencies. When Livia survives an assassination attempt while investigating an international child pornography ring, she learns that those behind the hit may work for the FBI. Livia recruits Dox, her partner from The Night Trade, to aid and abet her. Meanwhile, Rain\u2014who originally was offered the hit on Livia\u2014must come out of retirement to assemble a world-class team of black ops all-stars to battle a parallel threat. Persuasive action sequences lead to the merging of the two forces midway through the story. The feisty interplay among these killer elites is as irresistible as if one combined the Justice League with the Avengers, swapping out the superhero uniforms for cutting-edge weaponry and scintillating spycraft. By the satisfying conclusion, the world has been scrubbed a bit cleaner of perfidy. This is delightfully brutal fun. Agent: Laura Rennert, Andrea Brown Literary Agency. (Feb.)"}, {"Review": "Eisler knocks it out of the parkI've been an avid fan of Barry Eisler's work for a long time. When I heard he was working on another team up book in the vein of his previous 'The Detachment' that included Livia Lone, plus a couple of other characters not in the previous book, I was excited and knew that my expectations were going to be high. I'm happy to say he blew way past what I had hoped for. This may be the best novel he's written--and after the last two Livia and Rain prequel books that's an exceedingly high bar. The characters are all written well and stay faithful to their existing identities, but they also feel more fleshed out this time. I may be wrong, but it seems like since 'The God's Eye View', Eisler has expanded on the internal reflections and dialogues if his characters. Being inside John Rain's mind is a treat. He is, by now, an old friend of sorts. And his internal growth and burgeoning wisdom and maturity are great to see from first person. Livia is as multi-layered and complex as ever, and I'm happy to see her learn and open up and heal some, or at least be coming to terms with who she is(I'm still waiting for the friendly grappling match with Rain, Mr Eisler!). Dox is the class clown who has become counselor and dispenser of philosophical insights with his typical rakish charm and humor. Larrison in this outing is the most human, yet lethal, I've seen him--he perhaps grew on me more than any of the other characters this time around. I was very happy to see Delilah show up and add her skillset to the team. I'm not 100% on board with Ben Treven's contribution, but it was satisfying nonetheless. I knew the plot would involve sex-trafficking of some sort with Livia being one of the main characters--and boy did it, the revelation of hurt-core subculture was disturbing. All the moreso because of it's reality outside the pages of the book. As an aside, I'm pretty confident I had more of an emotional reaction to this part of the plot than the plots of the two previous Livia books. In fact, overall, I found myself more emotionally invested in this book, and the interplay between the characters, than previous books. I think Barry Eisler is a great writer, and I really think he shines better than ever here. On to the mostly spoiler-free plot; the team comes together over a large portion of the book in an organic and well-paced way. As the story builds they work with, against, and tangential to various agencies, both inside and outside the law, to uncover a plot that reaches to some of the highest levels of power all the while engaging shadowy international private contractors. The main story and personal plotlines all wrapped up very well. I initially thought it ended a bit fast, but upon reflection, it ended exactly how it would have in the real world after the protagonists completed their goals. There were some great references to real world events(like Snowden), a few inside jokes for those with the eyes to see it, some foreshadowing of what I assume is the next Rain prequel, and a little political commentary. In fact, if I had any criticism--and to be clear, criticism is too harsh a term, quibble would be more accurate--it would be that there were several stabs at the media and political over-infatuation with the narrative of Russia-as-bogeyman in the 2016 election and beyond. I get the reasons for this and it's a common critique from segments of the blogosphere that I read. It's even most definitely accurate criticism to some unknown extent--enough so I chuckled at some of the references and one character's obsession. But they felt oddly placed and stuck out to me as unnecessary for the story. And perhaps somewhat dismissive after what's been revealed by the Mueller investigation and researchers like Renee DiResta about the Internet Research Agency, and it's multi-front assault on social media since 2014-15. Again, less a criticism and more like something I'd love to discuss with the author to explore data points. Anyway, the research was meticulous, as always. The notes at the end provide a trove of avenues to go down for those who want further education on real-world inspirations for parts of the book, safety, tactical considerations, etc. All that to say I cannot recommend this book enough, though I would recommend all the previous books first so you don't have to play catch up. "}, {"Review": "For me, this book kinda felt a little like The Avengers 2 if you think of The Detachment as The Avengers (the Marvel rather than tea, cat suits and bowler hats version). I've read all of Barry's work from A Clean Kill In Tokyo to this one and look forward to each book every year since I caught up to wherever they stood at that point probably six years ago. First time I read The Detachment, it was like a great pay off of seeing the different corners of the Eislerverse come together all in a room and see how they got along. There was a bit of fan service in there, sure, but it was so fun and logical in its way that it was easily one of my favorites in the series. Back then, Treven was the new guy at the party. This time it's Livia Lone, who in many ways dominates the party. For better or worse, it's clear that Livia rather than Rain is Barry's favorite muse at the moment. After 9 other Rain novels, it's hard to blame him. And Livia is rather an increasingly alluring character. I was skeptical of Livia in the beginning after her first novel, weary of the current trend of the butt kicking 90 pound model we see so often play out on screen. But's hard not to be touched by her emotional struggles, impossible not to sympathize with her cause hunting sex criminals. And now we have Dox to garnish her books with a similar but not same accents of light that he provided to the Rain books. Except there is a fresh side of Dox here given his whole new edge and motivation. I'm a soft touch to these kinds of perhaps love stories that can either doom or revitalize. I look forward to finding out which in further chapters of the story. Without spoiling anything, this \"Avengers 2\" isn't just brining the band back together for fan service. It also provides opportunity for a bit of house cleaning for the Eislerverse. If you already read the novel, you know what I mean. I don't know about you, but I found this development less tragic than welcome and perhaps long overdue. Was never a fan and the performance in this book only underscored everything I found uninteresting in the past about [character identity redacted].  I'm not sure what a Rain novel looks like after this novel. I'll only say that I hope Larrison finds new life down the line in a Livia book and suggest perhaps it's time Dox got his own series. I admit I have a weak spot for characters like Dox. It's easy to dismiss him as the comic relief or like the fun, pizza eating turtle of the bunch. But I think there's a case to be made for Dox as being the deepest figure Barry writes about, which is saying something given the depths of Livia's misery we've had detailed, haha. Think about it. Dox is the light to the dark, but how natural is that for somebody easily as deadly as the people whose lives he accentuates. Dox is the least sociopathetic, so how does that work exactly, given that it could be argued he as a sniper at a distance goes through more humanity in cold blood than Rain or Livia who are generally more sporting with their prey (that could be argued when Rain is doing his \"natural causes\" routine). Yet Dox at least pretends to let it roll off his back. His humor, his womanizing are defense mechanisms, but how effective is it? Because it's not just his psychic weight he pulls, Dox makes it a point to get in and carry Rain's, Livia's and even Larrison's emotional baggage to whatever extent they'll allow. Dox plays the clown, acts the killer, but he's also the mother.I'd bet there is a side to Dox we haven't seen yet. I'd like to see where all that psychic wear and tear goes.
