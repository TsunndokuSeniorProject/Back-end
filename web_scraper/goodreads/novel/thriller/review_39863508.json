Thomas Christopher Greene draws readers in with a compulsively readable and magnificently manipulative storyline that teeters on the rudimentary line drawn between literary and contemporary fiction. This being the third of his books I\u2019ve read and what I would consider the darkest and most suspense-heavy yet.Max and Susannah\u2014along with her fifteen-year-old son\u2014have relocated to a small town in Vermont. Making a name for himself in the art world has afforded Max opportunities, the biggest being a professorship and the use of a gorgeous home for his family. Flying high in their new glossy life, thrown off-course when they're hit with the turbulence the note's insinuation creates. Anxiety rampant, and desperation to keep things under wraps, leads to some morally questionable moves. Just as Max relaxes, thinking he handled the situation, another note pops up, followed by a third. The short chapters, twist riddled plot and engaging flow of the author\u2019s words set a frantic pace. Although, not every twist is what I would call unpredictable. In fact, readers are made privy to some of the foreseeable decisions\u2014unpredictably replaced by gall. Part of the fun comes from the shock value Max\u2019s despicable actions lend to the story and the ease in which he manages to justifies them. Readers are led to contemplate, who of the two\u2014Max or Susannah\u2014is the perfect liar? Is it the dutiful wife who, despite her misgivings, stands by her husband\u2019s side? Or, is it the husband willing to go to any length to keep his secrets from reaching the light of day? Chances are\u2014whichever side you land on\u2014you have no idea what\u2019s in store or who in fact will prove to be the best liar. Until the end that is. The most fitting descriptor for the conclusion: adjective, ten letters, 4 syllables\u2014un\u00b7ex\u00b7pect\u00b7ed. *Thank you to St. Martin\u2019s Press for providing a review copy in exchange for my honest thoughts."}, {"Review": "\n3.5 starsEntertaining psychological thriller constructed around a skillful game of cat and mouse between husband and wife. \nMax and Susannah have a seemingly perfect marriage--but their marriage is built on a web of lies. Max, a rising star in the art world, has a secret past that he has worked hard to bury. However, the more famous he becomes, the greater the chance of exposure. Max is willing to quash any threat, no matter what it takes. Susannah, Max\u2019s loyal wife, has secrets of her own. When someone leaves an anonymous note on their front door threatening to expose their lies, their world starts to crumble. As their layers of deceit begin to slowly unravel, their marriage begins to disintegrate leading to the ultimate betrayal.As many other reviewers have noted, this is an addictive read. However, my enthusiasm waned after the reveal of the first big twist-- It felt like there was a shift in the tone as the suspense died down. Perhaps it was because the characters seemed a little too comfortable which lessened the tautness of their narratives? While I had a lot of fun reading this, there were too many loose threads and I was a little let down by the ending. I found the outcome predictable and given the devious nature of the characters, I was hoping that the author would take Max and Susannah\u2019s deception to another level. The narrative alternates between Max and Susannah\u2019s chapters, often recounting past events. I loved the playful snarky tone of Max\u2019s chapters but I didn\u2019t find Susannah\u2019s voice to be as compelling. I was greatly confused by the chapter between Max and Max W. I don\u2019t know why this one couldn\u2019t have occurred between Phil and Max W. as I often had to reread to determine which Max was which. I had a theory that would have made this ok, but I was wrong, so this chapter just left me confused. \nMy biggest gripe is that If all it took was doing a minimal google search to uncover a HUGE secret, then why hadn\u2019t more people caught on? \nOn the upside, both characters are intriguing, the plot kept me interested, and Thomas Christopher Greene has a knack for drawing in the reader. I will definitely be reading more by this author! \nOverall, I had a lot of fun going back and forth trying to determine just who was the \u201cperfect liar?\u201d\nI received and ARC of this book from NetGalley and St. Martin's Press in exchange for an honest review."}, {"Review": "\nAll consuming and wonderfully crafted story!\nI was hooked from the beginning and it just became more intense as the the author laid out all the clues that would lead to the haunting conclusion.The more I read, the more invested I was in the characters and it just became unputdownable at some point.

They soon married and eventually they moved to Vermont when Max gets a job there. Max, Susannah and Freddy like it in Vermont. Life is easy there. They are comfortable and happy until one day a note appears on their door. A note which reads I KNOW WHO YOU ARE. An honest person might think \"I know who I am too!

Max lies about who he is to gain access to the exclusive event. He is handsome, charismatic and knows how to read/work people. He instantly charms his way into Susannah's heart and they are married within six months of that fateful meeting. Susannah and Max are in love and happy. Max's career has taken off and the family relocates to a small town in Vermont where he will be a visiting professor. Everything is going their way. All seems perfect - until the first note arrives. \n\"I KNOW WHO YOU ARE\"\nAnxiety runs rampant and we begin to see that all is not what it appears within this family. There are desperate actions taken to assure their security. Just when Max think he can relax, another note appears, shortly followed by a third. Who is responsible? What do they want?We begin to see that there is much more than meets the eye with this family. Lies seem to come as easily as the intake of breath. So who exactly is The Perfect Liar? Is it Max - the man who will go to any lengths to get what he wants and keep it? Or is it Susannah - the seemingly dutiful wife with her own secrets and demons to hide? The story had an addictive quality to it with its frantic pace and short chapters. The author is definitely imaginative - unfortunately you have to really suspend your belief to fall in line with some of the twists the plot takes. Some of it proved too much of a stretch for me. I enjoyed the book overall and I definitely liked the aspect of a wolf in sheep's clothing and not all being what is seems despite my inability to fall in line with some of the plot points.

"}, {"Review": "I was hooked on this book right away. How could you not want to find out why someone is leaving anonymous notes on a couple's door saying things like \"I KNOW WHO YOU ARE\"? Totally creepy, but it made for a really entertaining read.The pacing in this book was excellent as the chapters were short and alternated between the husband, Max, and his wife, Susannah. As the story unfolds, you learn bit by bit about each of their pasts. The book definitely takes some interesting turns and while I wouldn't say they are all predictable, many of them are not really surprising. I don't really consider that a negative thing though because to me the book was so much more about these complex characters rather than a story solely based on catching the reader off guard. I just truly enjoyed seeing everything play out.Would definitely recommend to anyone who is in the mood for a solid psychological thriller.

There is nothing simple about the couple featured in Thomas Christopher Greene's latest novel of psychological suspense. Husband and wife both have more than their share of secrets and lies. Which one is the perfect liar? Hmmmm. This is a sexy, modern tale of murder and revenge. Only one-half of this couple is left standing in the end. Who will win out? I can't tell you. All the fun is in watching these two crazy characters try to out-manipulate each other and the world around them.I LOVED THIS ADDICTIVE NOVEL!! It's twistaliciously written and surprising to the end.

Loved it/ Not so much/ Then Loved it again/ And Everything in between.If you've skimmed over the reviews, you're gonna see a wavy mixture from intensely salty, to bland, to Five-Alarm Chili flavored. It's all in how deeply mired you become in the tilting CRAZY going on in these pages. If you have a tendency to lift the lid off the pot and re-read the recipe, this one may not thicken to your liking. But on the other hand, if you're open to some combustible ingredients, then this one will get your attention.Our two main characters are hardly likeable. Let's get that out there front and center. Susannah meets Max at a soiree for artists in New York. They are immediately taken with one another. Susannah is a widow with a teenage son. Max has been successful at giving TED talks with a very strange approach to Art. He is recently hired as a temporary staff member at a Vermont university. Freddy tolerates both adults by playing video games in his room. Typical family? Not so much.The shifting sands begin when the first note arrives. I KNOW WHO YOU ARE. Susannah finds it one morning taped to the front door. Max remains calm, but Susannah starts to freak out. As readers, we are uncertain as to whom this note is directed towards. It's followed by two others. It's then that Thomas Christopher Greene begins unpacking the sticks of dynamite from their canvas bags. It appears that both individuals in our sweet couple have Black Belts in Lying. That's where the whiplash comes in from following each of their backstories. Just keep focused on Wild and Woolly. Remember: The puzzle pieces don't always fit perfectly in a psychological thriller. Fear and uncertainty don't think rationally. Just go with the flow.The Perfect Liar is perfectly imperfect. But all along you'll be looking over your shoulder to see who strikes the match on those sticks of dynamite. BOOM!"}, {"Review": "There are two times I say WOW! when I finish a book. The first is \"WOW! How did that even get published\"? The second is \"WOW! That was sooo goooodd. I wish I could make the words flow that well\". The Perfect Liar was definitely the second of the two. It didn't have me on the edge of my seat at every chapter, but each chapter was always only a few pages, at the most. Which I like in books, because I tend to read them faster and the characters and such stay in my head fresher, for some reason.

It was my first read by this author and definitely won\u2019t be my last. Told in multiple POV (mostly in dual), 3rd person.

The story is told by alternating the point of view between them in each chapter giving a reader a look at both sides of the story.\u00a0Susannah had gotten herself into a relationship with a much older man which led her to becoming a widower with a young son. When Susannah met Max he seemed the perfect man for her seeing that he was also an artist and fit into Susannah and her son's life perfectly.\u00a0When offered a job in Vermont Susannah and Max take the leap moving from New York to their new quiet home. Quiet that is until one day Susannah finds a note left that reads \"I KNOW WHO YOU ARE\". Max is sure it's just a joke but Susannah can't help but wonder just how well does she know the man she married?The Perfect Liar is another of those books that when done I felt a bit so-so with it but I look around and seem to be missing something everyone else seemed to see. For me, I never really got to care a bit about Susannah or Max but that is something that sometimes happens with thrillers that I go into not trusting the story, you have \"liar\" in the title and it can't be helped.However, it didn't take long for my own theory to form about the outcome and again I pretty much figured out where it led so that was also a bit of a let down. Sure there were twists and turns along the way but seemed predictable to me leaving me with that meh feeling in the end.

From Susannah's relationship and later, marriage, to her therapist, who was 49 to her 21 years of age, when they first started seeing each other, we know that Susannah is strong willed and actively rebels against authority and conformity. Later, after her first husband dies, she eventually meets Max, an up and coming \"artist\" whose talent lies in words and manipulating those who pay to hear him speak. Almost from the time we meet Max, we know he is a murderer and that his life is a lie, as he lives life, using the identity of someone else, to be what he wants to be. He'll stop at nothing to attain his goals and Susannah comes to realize that almost everything that Max tells her, is either a lie, or based on a lie. Neither of these people are likable and for that reason, I had trouble caring much, about their present or future. I did care about Susannah's 17 year old son Fred, but it appears his future will be filled with lies and deceit, too. He is his mother's son and I think that shapes his future. At no time though, did I want to put down the book, before finishing it. The book is well written although the story will move from Susannah's viewpoint to Max's viewpoint, from one sentence to the next, with nothing to indicate a change. I was able to pick up the changes within quickly but it took me a while to get used to this way of writing and I think it'd be easier to read the book with some distinct breaks between viewpoints. Also, Max shaves his head, a habit that Max took on to become another identity, but in at least two areas, there is mention of the hair on his head. I think it's interesting that during Susannah's marriage to Max, she takes on her mother's passiveness (being a homemaker and catering totally to her husband's and son's needs) which others can see, while at the same time, having a hidden part of herself, someone who smokes in secret everyday and who even has a stuffed fox that she hides in her closet. It'll be up to the reader to decide the identity of the perfect liar, because Susannah and Max hide so much of their real selves.Thank you to St. Martin's Press and NetGalley for this ARC."}, {"Review": "Scintillating writing, robust characters and brilliantly plotted.

It\u2019s told from the alternating perspectives of Max and Susannah. Each has their own story to tell, and it all unwinds in due course. The story is a ricocheting tale of lies and it\u2019s impossible to put down the book. Max and Susannah\u2019s characters are unique and well defined. Both with strengths and weakness which make them real. You might not like them but they really make for interesting and robust characters.

"}, {"Review": "A chilling tale of hidden secrets that surface and threaten a married couple\u2019s new life together. The tension builds as lies are revealed and we\u2019re left to decide who \u201cThe Perfect Liar\u201d is. So many delicious twists...as we\u2019re lead to an unexpected and impressive ending! Susannah and Max are a new couple that married after a brief courtship...and each have secrets from their past that they haven\u2019t shared with their new partner. Susannah met the charismatic artist at a NYC party, when he first made his appearance into the art world. She was a struggling young widow with a teenage son...and was drawn to his charm and energy. She\u2019s strong-willed and anxious, but Max has a way of calming her and keeping her grounded. A job offer from the University of Vermont moves them to a slower-paced life...away from the NYC art scene and pasts they want to forget. Then Susannah finds a note on their door\u2014I KNOW WHO YOU ARE\u2014and the new stress-free life starts to crumble. In a panic, she calls Max, who is out of town lecturing. He dismisses it as a prank, but in the back of his mind he begins to wonder if someone has uncovered his lies. Susannah is also wondering if her past is creeping into her new life...or maybe she doesn\u2019t know Max as well as she thought. She was attracted to his mysterious, artistic side, but now she\u2019s curious about his estranged family and lack of friends. He just appeared in the art world\u2014almost overnight.Another note appears, and then one of Max\u2019s colleagues is killed in a tragic accident. It\u2019s clear that someone has an agenda...but whose secrets are threatening their future?Thank you to NetGalley, Goodreads Giveaways and St. Martin\u2019s Press for this ARC, in exchange for my honest review!#ThePerfectLiar #NetGalley"}, {"Review": "I guess I\u2019m in the minority here, because I wasn\u2019t a fan! I felt like the characters actions had zero explanation - there was no elaboration on anyone\u2019s motives, so I had a hard time connecting with any of them or understanding why they were doing what they were doing. I also found it pretty boring. I felt like there were no twists and turns, and the ones that did exist were so minor and anticlimactic that I kept thinking *something* had to be coming down the pipeline, but nope. All in all, this one was disappointing to me. If you like more of a straightforward mystery without the twists, you may enjoy this one more than I did. "}, {"Review": "Susannah is a single mother.

I loved it.I was give a copy by the publisher for my honest review.Dawn Ruby-BookGypsyNovels N Latte Book BlogNovels & Latte Book ClubHudson Valley NY"}, {"Review": "Tl;dr: Short, taut domestic thriller that poses a lot of interesting questions, definitely for fans of psychological suspense.The Perfect Liar is the perfect title for this book because, in the end, who is the perfect liar?This one is sort of like The Talented Mr. Ripley meets Gone Girl with no one being what they seem and it leaves (or at least left me!) really intrigued by the way that central question--who is the biggest liar, are they perfect at it-- or unaware? Or aware yet not, at least on the surface?It's impossible for me to talk about the novel without talking about the end so...SPOILER SPACESPOILERSPACESPOILERSPACEOk! So, that ending! Max, to me, seems to be the perfect liar at first but he's so not--Susannah is. I mean, yes, Max has a great con going, the kind of one you do read pieces on in Vanity Fair or The New Yorker (loved the nod to that at the end, btw) but I think Susannah is really the biggest--and best--liar of all, although I can see the case for everything she does being in reaction to what happens/did happen to her.I think Susannah is not reacting--I think she's whatever she wants who she's with to be until she's done. And then she's *really* done, and unlike Max, who thinks and is presented throughout, as someone who is both immensely pleased by and very, very good at presentation.Max goes from teen/early adult vagabond to on the fly murder to aspiring artist (because the art world, he senses, will be a perfect place to be who people want to see) to a knowing success, to superstar who is \"beyond\" art and in demand for motivational talks that he (and us) know are just him playing to the crowd, to academic (Greene really shines with this, it's clear he's in academia but isn't afraid to call it on its bullsh*t)-- and then murderer again but this time Susannah has it and him all figured out but hey, she's all over the place and he's got it under control and if she has to go, well...And then he's dead. His mistake is seeing Susannah as she presents herself and how she is, on the surface, written. She's a art school dropout who never did what her family wanted, met a therapist who could calm her always busy mind (she thinks of it as panic, her son thinks she's just unmoored, and Max thinks she needs him as an anchor--I think she's just bored until she's ready to make a move) and seduced him, then got pregnant. Susannah narrates that part of her life, and in it, she's a victim. And while there's no doubt that her family turned away from her, and Joseph, the therapist, was questionable at best, and unhinged at worst (that dog cage scene, yikes!)--you have to wonder. She's very open about the defiance (I would call it choice) to get pregnant and huh, the minute Joseph isn't helping her/pushing her as hard as he can because he thinks he can/she realizes he's old--bam! He's dead. Technically, she tells her son when it all comes out, he was mostly dead anyway. (Oh, well then, ok!?)Then there's Max. When Susannah meets him, he confesses he's crashing the party (literally and figuratively) but, in his mind, dazzles her so much he gets her and surprises himself by loving her as much as she does him. Luckily he knows how to handle her, and sure, there are moments when Susannah wonders about his past, but in her recollection they are just little hiccups. He's the father figure she wanted for her son, he's successful enough to get them out of New York City and to a perfect home in Vermont--he's perfect. And then notes start appearing and she's freaking out and Max-- she can see that under that calm exterior is rage. So much rage.It's not aimed at her, but she sees it and it scares her, and in the end, Max has sort of confessed about his past and he's killed someone and the police have been coming around and she panics, grabs her son, a whole lot of cash, and meanders into an escape that's foiled by her boy being a teenager and texting Max because he thinks \"Mom is acting cray cray\"--so she returns home and all is well except for the cop who talks to her but she doesn't say anything, just tells the story of meeting Max ( and whoops, that part where he told her he wasn't exactly an artist yet, but hey, now he is!) So, Max knows he needs to get Susannah calmed down and possibly out of the picture, so it's family vacation time and Susannah is getting all panicked again, phones the cop she spoke to (managed to keep the card the cop gave her, you see) and says she finally realizes she's in danger and then, before he can kill her, she kills Max but she was terrified and the cop says to tell everyone that Max fell off the cliff Susannah pushed him off, to say it was suicide, and Susannah is just so grateful she and her son are safe and besides, with what they know about Max, he's killed before and she was probably next.Except Except for that one sentence about how funny it was that Max died exactly one day after the university where he was working life insurance policy kicked in, guaranteed money even if the cause of death is suicide.And Max becomes even more famous once he's dead, and Susannah, after all this time, finds an artistic streak she thought she lacked and now back in New York, her works (funnily enough, all about murder, but of course in reference to Max's deeds and her surviving him) are very in demand and now she's more than well on her way to becoming famous in her own right.So. Is Susannah just a woman with a knack for falling into one dangerous pattern after another and finally, finally getting lucky enough to escape?Maybe. But I don't think so.Last two lines of the book:\"So many people are dying to meet you,\" Lydia said.\"Bring me to them.\"I rest my case.I was provided with an ARC of this by St Martin's and Netgalley in return for an honest review. (And apparently, in my case, a very, very long one!)Five stars for this disturbing but utterly delightful mindf*ck of a read. I can't wait for this to come out so I can talk it up all the time."}, {"Review": "The Perfect Liar wasn\u2019t a good fit for me. I didn\u2019t hate it, I didn\u2019t love it- it just fell somewhere in the middle, 3 stars. I found it hard to relate to any of the characters or even find them mildly likable which kept me from really enjoying the book and getting lost in it. Thomas Christopher Greene\u2019s writing was strong and I would definitely read another book by him in hopes that the characters were more my speed, I\u2019ll even take a character you love to hate. The Perfect Liar will definitely work for some people. I can even think of a few friends who I will recommend this to despite it not being my favorite read. Thank you Netgalley and St. Martin\u2019s Press for an e-ARC OF The Perfect Liar in exchange for my honest review."}, {"Review": "This rating is really between 3 - 3.5 stars.The first thing I would like to point out is this book has the perfect title. Who exactly is the perfect liar? The book will have you guessing the answer to this several times throughout the story. I loved how the book grabs you in the beginning with Susannah coming home to a note on her door - 'I know what you did'. Does that not give you the chills? The plot is intriguing, though it fell a hair flat for a good bit of it after that explosive opener. Then at about three-quarters through the book it picks back up and ends strongly. While you know that several of the characters are liars, it's surprising what the lies are, who is telling the lies and when - it's deliciously deceptive. I liked the character development, the short chapters and the storyline being told from different points of view. The few unexpected twists makes this an enjoyable read. My thanks to Thomas Christopher Greene, St. Martin's Press and Netgalley for a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review."}], "Genre": "Thriller", "ID": "39863508", "Desc": ""}
