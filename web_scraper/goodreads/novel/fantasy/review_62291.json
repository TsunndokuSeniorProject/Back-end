{"Genre": "Fantasy", "ID": "62291", "Name": "A Storm of Swords", "Reviews": [{"Review": "\nThis book made me want to throw it against the wall in anger and disbelief.\n It made me root for the death of a child (and then despise myself), love a hated character, cry angry tears, and bite my nails because of all the suspense.**Pictograhically, all of the above was happening to me.**I did not throw the book across the room. Instead, I put it aside and stared at the wall for a few minutes in grief and disbelief. If you read this, you know which part I am talking about *SOBBING* Then I picked it up again, because at that point I was so hooked that nothing could have stopped me. (I also MAY HAVE cut my neurobiology class to finish it. I know, I'm bad, very very bad.)Ah, you guys... Look at you, all innocent, before this book rips into you...A Storm of Swords is, in my opinion, an undisputed high point of the series so far. It expanded the story in delightful, wonderful ways. It gave it a truly epic feel. It delivered the cruel punch in the gut with the (view spoiler)[Red Wedding  (hide spoiler)](excuse me as I go and cry myself to sleep) and reinforced the axiom that nobody is safe in the world GRRM created. (*) * It was heartbreaking, gut-wrenching, and unexpected. But it was necessary, even if just to remind how cruel and brutal this world is, and how little choices can have huge consequences.\n I loved this book because of the amount of promise it brought to the series. It brought our characters to the brink of greatness, put them in the positions that were surely going to change the course of this entire story.  Examples: Jon and Dany. It was amazing to see how these two very young characters grew and developed due to all the battles, losses, and betrayals that they suffered. Both of them at the end of this story carry such potential for the future of this series. (view spoiler)[Having read book 5, I think that so much of it was unfortunately wasted. (hide spoiler)]\n Ah, our favorite despicable Lannisters... Look at you BEFORE all the hell broke loose for you. Does it make you feel any sympathy for the Starks now? No? I thought so.The character complexity parallels the story complexity - both are done masterfully. The characters feel alive and real. They are interesting and fascinating, and fluctuate between likable and despicable in a not too predictable fashion (*). The previously unseen connections between characters and events are mind-blowing. And seeing the select few skillfully manipulating so many others is unsettling. * Let me use Jaime and Tyrion as my examples here: \nJaime became one of my favorites: understanding where he's coming from and seeing him humbled by his experience changed him from a monster to a deeply flawed but ultimately sympathetic man. (What he did to Bran was terrible - but child's play in comparison of all the other mindf***ery GRRM gives us in this book. What he does with his sister - gross, but they are competent and consenting adults, and it's not my place to judge them). Tyrion, on the other hand... What he did to Shae reminded me that darkness can live inside everyone, even our favorite Imp. (view spoiler)[Tywin, however - I did not give a crap about him (pun intended!), but Shae...Not cool. (hide spoiler)]\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------Don't get me wrong. I gush about it, but this book is far from perfect. Just like its sequels (and predecessors) it suffers from overload of descriptions and repetitions, gratuitous bodily functions and banquets. Some storylines already begin to drag (Arya, for instance). But most of the faults were easily overshadowed by the great characterization, masterful story, and wonderfully built suspense. This is what I felt was unfortunately missing from the books that followed, and what I hope they return to eventually.\n5 stars from my (many moons ago) yet-not-jaded self that happily gobbled up this delicious brain candy.\n"}, {"Review": "it's time again for...

I thought why is so much of this familiar. Then I thought, \"Oh yeah, stupid, you own and have watched all of the current shows!\" <--- I mean duh! I was going to give this one 4 stars because it's the one where they kill more of the Stark's and wolf and I wanted to go in, turn into my own dragon and burn them all down! but then . . . THIS \u2193Oh happy day! Oh happy day! What joy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! \u2764I love so many people on the show and in the books. But my favorites are: 1) Jon \u27642) Tyrion3) Arya4) Daenerys5) Brienne6) Sam7) Sansain no particular order because I tried that one already. In the book there were certain scenes I liked better than I did in the shows. I love the shows and I love the books so far. But, in this book there were more parts with dialogue that I really enjoyed. My favorite in this book were the scenes between Brienne and Jaime. I know, you didn't see that coming right? I mean you would think it would have been all the parts about Jon since he's my hunneh bunneh but nope. I liked his parts better in the show and nooo it's not because I can look at him in the show. Although. . . nevermind. I just felt like there was so much more to Brienne and Jaime's time together in the book. I wished he would have quit calling her ugly and such though. Jerk, but they did seem to be friends of a sort at the end of their time and I liked that. The things you miss in any book is the commentary in someone's head. Of course some I would rather not read about. But I really loved the parts where we could read Tyrion's thoughts about Sansa. They were sweet and true and sad in many ways. Overall I enjoyed the book because of the parts with Joffrey dying. Bwhahahahaahahahahahahah! And the parts with Brienne and Jaime. I loved all of my other characters parts but these were the highlight moments for me. Or course you know when you get rid of one evil b\u2022stard, along comes another one!MY BLOG: Melissa Martin's Reading List"}, {"Review": "Merciless and brilliant.This was unbelievably amazing. A Storm of Swords could actually be the height of George R. R. Martin\u2019s writing career. I know I haven\u2019t read A Feast for Crows, A Dance with Dragons, or the extra books of the series yet, but realistically speaking, it would be bloody difficult for Martin to top what he has achieved in this book.Picture: A Storm of Swords by Marc SimonettiI\u2019ll try to make this review shorter than usual and I won\u2019t be talking about the story at all to avoid spoilers. Seriously, you have to experience this for yourself. If you miraculously haven\u2019t watched the TV series, A Storm of Swords encompassed season 3 and 4 of the TV series. I have known the main twists of this installment from watching the TV show but somehow the book was still able to fully capture my attention. It brings me to this point once again: I can\u2019t even imagine how much I\u2019ll love this traumatizing book IF I\u2019ve read it without having watched the TV series adaptation.\n\n\u201cOld stories are like old friends, she used to say. You have to visit them from time to time.\u201d\n\nThis, of course, doesn\u2019t mean that you should skip the TV series. Up to season 4, the TV series adaptation remains mostly loyal to the original material. Sure it\u2019s not like the first season anymore where it was pretty much scene by scene adaptation, but I do honestly think that there were a lot of moments that the TV series did even better than the book. I highly loved what I\u2019ve read so far in A Song of Ice and Fire; this novel, in particular, is currently my favorite from the series. However, from my experience reading the series, I can say that I\u2019m not a huge fan of Martin\u2019s prose during his battle scenes. They were great but I personally think there are other grimdark fantasy authors that wrote battle scenes much better than Martin; Joe Abercrombie and Steven Erikson to name a few. The battle scenes were one factor where the TV show excelled in. Also, I will never stop praising Peter Dinklage\u2019s acting performance as Tyrion Lannister that totally did justice to the superb characterizations that the character has; same goes for many of the actor and actresses performance.\n\n\u201cRhaegar fought valiantly, Rhaegar fought nobly, Rhaegar fought honorably. And Rhaegar died.\u201d\n\nI loved reading the series not because of the battle scenes, but for the characterizations, intricate world-building, how Martin set up a scene smartly, and the immense strength in the unpredictability of the storyline; all proven clearly with this book. The myriad pivotal events that occurred in this single installment were simply unforgettable. The Red Wedding, for example, is one of the, if not THE most traumatizing event to ever occurred in a fantasy novel for me; it pretty much has become a standard of comparison for brutality and shocking scale in speculative fiction. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t as crazy as The Red Wedding,\u201d or \u201cIt was more traumatizing than The Red Wedding.\u201d You probably have read or heard these phrases on reviews or on social media due to the super exposure caused by the TV shows, let me tell you that they\u2019re there for many good reasons.\n\n\u201cIt all goes back and back,\" Tyrion thought, \"to our mothers and fathers and theirs before them. We are puppets dancing on the strings of those who came before us, and one day our own children will take up our strings and dance in our steads.\u201d\n\nAt 414k words\u2014roughly 23 hours for me to read\u2014this has become the third biggest novel I\u2019ve read since The Stand by Stephen King and Oathbringer by Brandon Sanderson. I found it astounding that there was close to zero dull moments; well, I guess there\u2019s Bran\u2019s boring storyline but his role in this book is very small. Excluding Bran\u2019s story, I was completely immersed and I was in love with every page I read. Martin sang a song of violence, grief, and treachery with much impact; the writing was thoroughly engaging, full of memorable speeches, and the phrases were cleverly structured to be evocative.\n\n\u201cThe greatest fools are ofttimes more clever than the men who laugh at them.\u201d\n\nExcluding the fame he gets from the TV series adaptation, if you\u2019re ever in need of an evident proof on why George R. R. Martin has become one of the legendary fantasy authors of our time, A Storm of Swords is the answer. Although the series is still incomplete, I honestly think that it\u2019s worth reading the series just to experience the one of a kind reading experience provided in this tome. I loved this book, I'm giving it a full 5 stars rating; I'm extremely confident it would've been one of those ultra rare 6 out of 5 stars if I've read it without any knowledge of the plot.You can

still do not have one...sadface.This series !!! What can I say I am loving it! I don't know if I was just sick of everything else or just needed the escape but I am soooooo enjoying. The great thing is that I am on the third book and its not like I can't say which book I like better, which was weaker they are one long story that come in three(so far for me) packages.Its not like Indiana Jones. Where we say\" man I love Indiana Jones but... that second one WTH? \" You know, with Kate Capshaw and her never ending shriek and there were monkey brains.Do you remember the monkey brains? I remember the monkey brains.Refresher\n**I will make no mention of Indiana Jones and the skull of shit or whatever it was called because I have decided that Harrison Ford needed a new boat and it should not be included in the series.Anyways A Song of Fire and Ice seems to different from the other series I have read *cough* Sookie Stackhouse *cough*. I find them very refreshing and I never have any idea where its going or how he is going to get us there,also do not get attached to anyone cause George R R Martin be killing bitches left right and center. No one is safe.Confession time: I seem to have a crush on The Hound\nWHAT? Shut up! I dont want to talk about it!\nWhatever! I am not even sure he is alive,the last time we saw him he was feeling a bit stabbed under a tree and I am not puting a \"spoiler tag\" on that, cause if I don't know then I am not spoiling anything. Maybe its cause he is so grumpy? This series brings out some weird attractions, my friend said she thought Littlefinger was sexy, he is a quirky mother f@&ker I'll give ya that, also she did not judge my hound problem so we're good."}, {"Review": "HAPPY SEASON 4 FINALE EVE, NERDIES!!!

(hide spoiler)]but those were just minor flaws in what is otherwise a great book. george martin is good at a number of different things. for epic fantasy, which is usually defined by action sequences and the large-scale, his books are so skillful at the quiet moments. don't get me wrong, there are plenty of HUGE scenes in this book, but there are also so many small conversations that are seemingly inconsequential to the overall storyline, but they go so far towards character development, which is something lost in a lot of genre-fiction. these characters are vivid, and their decisions (mostly - see gripe number 2) make sense in terms of their positions and ambitions and survival instincts.and they will affect you.i started reading this while i was re-watching the first season of the wire, which is an exercise i strongly recommend. there are so many parallels, in the way that characters operate within the parameters of \"the game,\" and their individual codes of honor and behavior, and in the rises and falls of characters that are predicated upon such seemingly inconsequential events. the long drawn-out cause-and-effect situations, they are masterful and span seasons/books, which is such a delight to a fan.which search led me to this:and, oh, god, i love the internet:http://asongoficeandwire.tumblr.com/is there anything you do not have, internet??this book is \"everyone's\" favorite, but for me, i think i like the second book better. yet i understand the feeling people have for this; the great love and the great heartbreak. and - oh - the way he takes things we thought we already understood from as far back as the first book; about jon arryn and about tysha, and he's all \"nahhhh, this is what happened for real.\" so very cool. just when you thought you had closure...it is an easy series to get addicted to. there are some problems, for sure, some of the writing occasionally can be cliched, and there is some repetition that is a little tedious, but overall, this is a character-driven series that has great scenes of action, is genuinely funny in a lot of places, and the strategies of characters are worth it. remember that as you struggle through the lyrics to \"the bear and the maiden fair\" for the hundredth time.incidentally, i would read an entire series of novels featuring jaime and brienne on a road trip.in closing:DAENERYS!!!!i love her so much.come to my blog!"}, {"Review": "This year (2011) has been rough for those of us who count ourselves Minnesota Twins fans. A few weeks ago, however, I watched Francisco Liriano nearly pitch a perfect game. Earlier in the season, Liriano pitched a no-hitter, which was a bright spot in an otherwise unremitting series of losses, injuries, and disappointment. But this was different. This meant more. This was a perfect game (and you can\u2019t get better than perfect). The announcers, with no regard for karma, started talking about the possibility in the fifth inning. I didn't start to get excited until the seventh. I thought to myself: I might be watching something for the history books. Then, in the eighth, the third baseman made an error, and the perfect game was over (the following inning, he lost his no-hit bid as well). The game went down as a victory for the Twins, and for Liriano, but it will be lost in the eddies of baseball history. It was a very good game; but it was not a masterpiece.Back in May 2007, I watched the season finale of the third season of Lost. The series, which focused on a group of airplane crash survivors on a mysterious island, became a pop cultural phenomenon with its intriguing present-day storyline intercut with meaningful flashbacks to the off-island lives of the passengers.The third season was up-and-down, but after a strong homestretch, Lost gave us a finale for the ages. In the final moments, the show revealed that the flashbacks we thought we\u2019d been watching for the previous two hours were actually flash-forwards, and that some of the passengers had gotten off the island. After picking up the pieces of my brain, I thought to myself, I might be watching the greatest television show of all time. Flash forward to 2010, when Lost concluded with a melodramatically satisfying but substantively hollow conclusion. It ended as a very good series, with individual episodes as strong as anything that ever aired on television, but it was not a masterpiece. I just finished George R.R. Martin\u2019s A Storm of Swords, and I\u2019m getting the same feeling I did watching Liriano in the 7th inning, or watching the third season finale of Lost: the thought that I might be in the midst of something special. Something that might linger and last. Something that be be considered a classic. Not classic fantasy. But a bona fide literary monument. I have grave doubts that Martin can finish this series, or that he can finish it with the same strength with which he started (reviews of the next book, A Feast for the Crows are not encouraging), but when I finished the last page, I certainly sensed the possibility of greatness. If Martin can finish this \u2013 if \u2013 then he will have accomplished a feat that will demand attention (including from those snotty New York Times Book reviewers who won\u2019t read \u201cfantasy\u201d). Swords is Book Three in Martin\u2019s A Song of Ice and Fire cycle. It begins where Book Two, A Clash of Kings left off. At the end of Kings, we were treated to the epic battle of the Blackwater; Winterfell was razed; the Night\u2019s Watch was north of the Wall; and it appeared that the Lannisters, including the young, sociopathic King Joffrey, were ascendant. My main critique of Kings was that it started slowly and maintained that agonizing pace right up until a blistering third act that completely reshaped my feelings. Storm doesn\u2019t bother with a slow build-up. It gets into things from the first page. From front to back, this is the best of the series so far, and a stunning novel in any light. The ever-expanding plot of A Song of Ice and Fire is impossible to summarize neatly. In Storm, as in the other books of this series, the story is told from the alternating viewpoints of various characters. The selected viewpoints are: Jaime Lannister, Tyrion Lannister, Jon Snow, Catelyn Stark, Arya Stark, Sansa Stark, Bran Stark, Samwell Tarly, Davos Seaworth, and Daenerys Targaryen. I sometimes criticized the point-of-view choices in the first two books, for the reason that Martin\u2019s decisions often led to viewpoint redundancies and glaring blind spots. That is, Martin would often have several characters in one place, talking about one thing, while huge swaths of the storyline lacked a single witness. As a consequence, big chunks of exposition, central to the plot, were fed to the reader as secondhand hearsay, rather than experienced by a beloved character. For the most part, this problem does not arise with Storm. The viewpoint characters are well chosen and spread out across Westeros, doing things rather than talking about them. Sam is with the Night\u2019s Watch beyond the Wall, being chased by the Others (they\u2019re a kind of cold-weather mash-up of vampires and zombies). Jon is riding with Mance Ryder\u2019s free-folk in a sort of Dances With Wildings subplot that allows us some insight into the wildlings lifestyle (and occasions any number of hastily-scrawled sex scenes). Catelyn is with her son Robb, the King of the North, who blunders badly by breaking his oath to marry a Frey daughter. Jaime Lannister embarks on a perilous journey back to King\u2019s Landing, guarded by the female knight Brienne of Tarth. Meanwhile, back in King\u2019s Landing, a wounded Tyrion awakens to find that his good deeds have not helped his standing. The presence of his father, Tywin Lannister (a great peripheral character), and the scheming of his sister, Cersei, threatens his position at court. Across the sea, Daenerys gathers an army she hopes will allow her to retake Westeros. Of course, not all the viewpoint characters are created equally. Sansa Stark finally has things to do (and finally rejoins the plot; she has basically stood mute since betraying her father Eddard in A Game of Thrones), but she is still dumber than a garden gnome. Martin finally convinced me that Davos Seaworth, loyal to royal pretender Stannis Baratheon, is an important character; unfortunately, his importance does not make him interesting. Like Eddard Stark before him, Seaworth\u2019s square, dogged sense of honor \u2013 shorn of wit or pragmatism \u2013 makes him an uninspired character.These criticisms are only half hearted, though. The overall quality of Martin\u2019s plotting choices easily cover up the fact that, in a game of chess between Sansa and a sack of unpeeled potatoes, I would wager on the potatoes. Even an otherwise tiresome character such as Samwell Tarly, who is the sniveling heir of Tolkien\u2019s Samwise Gamgee, is given things to do. Heck, I even grew to like Daenerys. In the first two books, I was wholly underwhelmed by her subplot. Though I fully understand (or think I understand) Martin\u2019s endgame with respect to Daenerys, I didn't like how he kept cutting away from the main story to heap page after page upon this unconnected plot thread. In Storm, Daenerys does not get much closer to joining the rest of the book, but she does get to kick some ass. I never figured I\u2019d be a person to get much enjoyment from a dragon unleashing fire on an unassuming victim. I was wrong. Many of the highlights of this book I will not touch, even vaguely. Things happen that are surprising, shocking, and heart-wrenching. If at all possible, you should attempt to finish this book before accidentally stumbling across a massive spoiler. Surprises aside, many of Storm\u2019s highlights stem from four characters in particular: Jaime the Kingslayer; Jon Snow of the Night\u2019s Watch; Arya Stark; and Tyrion the Imp. Storm is the first book in which Jaime becomes a viewpoint character. In the past, we knew him as the sister-f***ing, child-defenestrating, king-killing sword master. He appeared a cruel, golden-haired villain, one who inspired terror in the heart of our putative heroes, the Starks (the further you get into A Song of Ice and Fire, the less sure you become about who the heroes and villains really are). In Storm, Jaime spends much of his time on the dangerous, outlaw-infested roads back to King\u2019s Landing. Though his chapters are hampered by his unfortunate, almost Tourette Syndrome-like use of the word wench, we learn a lot from Jamie about his time guarding Mad King Aerys. What we learn causes us to seriously reevaluate our earlier judgments, and begins nudging him along the villain-hero spectrum. Jon\u2019s story is where the bulk of the action happens. And by action, I mean fighting and sex. Without giving away too much, I think it\u2019s appropriate to say that Jon is at the center of a battle on the scale of Return of the Kings\u2019 Pelennor Fields. This battle really tilts A Song of Ice and Fire away from the realistic-fantasy from A Game of Thrones and into the fantasy-fantasy of The Lord of the Rings. There are mammoths and giants and spying eagles, but I didn't care, because there were also catapults and trebuchets and murder holes and burning oil. In other words, cool stuff. Arya was one of those characters I initially didn't like. For some reason, thematically or otherwise, Martin has chosen for viewpoint characters a high number of children, persons with disabilities, and children with disabilities (I\u2019m not including Sansa\u2019s low-functioning, though I could). This means that a lot of our protagonists are a bit atypical; furthermore, many of them haven\u2019t had a lot to do till now. In Storm, the kids finally start to grow up. Bran, the crippled boy, takes some huge strides in terms of reader-interest, as he begins to harness his shape-shifting abilities. However, I was more impressed with Arya\u2019s storyline. She falls in with a gang of outlaws, joins forces with Sandor \u201cthe Hound\u201d Clegane, and generally blurs the moral dividing line between good and bad. It\u2019s a bold authorial choice when you take a relatively innocent child character and slowly turn her into a cold, steel-eyed killer. Finally, Tyrion remains the transcendent character he was in the first two installments. I expected his droll wit and smartass remarks to start wearing thin, but Martin\u2019s choice to put Tyrion on the defensive, hemmed in by his father and sister, was an act of genius. It kept him evolving, which is no small feat after we\u2019ve spent so much time with him. What I\u2019ve just mentioned is just a smattering of the pleasures within A Storm of Swords, a novel that is overstuffed with awesome. This is a big book, and there is room for everything a fiction fan \u2013 not just a fantasy fan \u2013 could want: swordfights, torture, poison, beheadings, betrayals, shocking deaths, shocking fake-deaths, terrifying beasts, chuckle-inducing sex scenes, large scale battles, miracles. As I\u2019ve already mentioned, there are a lot more supernatural and fantastical aspects than before. These are things that might have been off-putting for the old me, the me who never read fantasy. It\u2019s even possible that I never would\u2019ve started A Game of Thrones if these things has existed at the start. Well, too late; I\u2019ve been sucked in. Besides, Martin does a really good job of grounding these aspects with his no nonsense, matter-of-fact descriptions. It was easy for me to accept the prospect of dragons because Martin describes them with such biological precision. And it was easy for me to accept the storyline of Lord Beric Dondarrion, who is repeatedly killed and brought back to life by the Red Priest Thoros, because Martin\u2019s portrayal of Beric is so gruesomely detailed (Beric is given life, but he is not healed; he walks around with a crushed skull and a missing eye). For those of you who prefer Tolkien\u2019s wordy, action-light style to numerous beheadings, maimings, and juvenile descriptions of oral sex, Storm should satisfy those cravings as well. Amid all the slayings and treachery, Martin still finds time for his characters to tell lengthy stories about the old days, and the long, violent, exciting history of Westeros. There are even songs! This is a great novel. Not great fantasy; great literature. Martin\u2019s prose is not elegant. Rather, it is detailed. He writes descriptively but clearly. His style is to create visual images with words. Accordingly, he goes to great lengths telling you about architecture, physical features, clothing, colors, and smells. Even minor castles or minor characters are imbued with depth. It can sometimes be overwhelming, trying to keep all this detail straight. Mostly, though, the result is a novel that is immersive and tactile. You feel surrounded by Martin\u2019s world. You feel like you can gauge the reactions of Martin\u2019s characters. There may be dragons and sorceresses and the walking dead, but it feels real. That is not the extent of Martin\u2019s talent. He has a marvelous sense of humor, and a nice, organic wit threads its way through novel, leavening the dour proceedings. Martin also has a nicely-tuned sense of dialogue. There are enough crisp one-liners and bon mots to put one in mind of The Godfather. Storm is the midpoint of what Martin has said will be a seven-book cycle. I would be lying if I said I didn't have grave concerns (grave being relative, of course) about the rest of the series. There are so many variables as to make a prediction impossible. Can Martin sustain this dense style? Does he have any idea where all his plotlines are heading? Will success, riches, and fame blunt his skills? Does he have enough years left in his life to finish this grand project? It\u2019d be nice to say these questions don\u2019t matter, that A Storm of Swords and the other completed novels can stand on their own. They can\u2019t. Ultimately, Storm will be judged upon the entirety of A Song of Ice and Fire. If the cycle falters, or is left unfinished, then Storm will be reevaluated along with the rest. There is no denying Storm\u2019s essential qualities. It remains to be seen, however, whether it is part of a masterpiece, or something a bit less. "}, {"Review": "Each one of these humongous books has managed to completely captivate me. I have loved listening to the characters evolve with this series as their fantastical world changes around them. Nothing is off-limits and nobody is sacred. As anxious as it makes me, the fact that I never know what to expect next is a big plus for me. When you read as much as I do, it is rare to be surprised, but Mr. Martin manages to keep me guessing.While the second book had multiple kings rising to power and fighting for their piece of the Iron Throne, this book took the story in an entirely different direction. What goes up must come down. In this epic saga full of scheming and betrayals, the power players are constantly changing. 'A Storm of Swords' completely changes the landscape of this story yet again.Aside from the fall of kings, the way the characters are presented had me rethinking my previous judgments. As each character's thoughts and actions were explored, it became clear that there is no \"good\" or \"bad\" person. Even despicable characters had redeeming qualities and/or motivations that were understandable, if not admirable. Similarly, the less than pure intentions and actions of some of my favorite characters were brought to light. Everyone is flawed and vulnerable in some way.The only exception to this was Joffrey. I couldn't find a single redeeming quality in that evil brat. Maybe it was there and my hatred for him just wouldn't allow me to see it. Nonetheless, he remained true to his role of \"ultimate villain\".As with the first two books in the series, be prepared for plenty of blood and gore. Characters will die, sometimes gruesomely. Don't get too attached. This definitely isn't a series for the faint of heart. Now that I've finished the third book, I can begin to spot some of the inconsistencies between the books and the HBO series. There are some omissions that have been made, but nothing that I thought was critical to this story so far. I've also noticed that a few things are presented out of sequence. Again, this didn't take away from the enjoyment for me, but it was noticeable if you're reading and watching subsequently.Overall, I am still loving this story. It is still confusing at times, with an extremely complex storyline. However, I feel like I'm getting a better grasp on things. It's on to the next one for me."}, {"Review": "When I first read A Game of Thrones  I hated Jaime Lannister. Now, I think he\u2019s awesome. If someone would have told me then, that by book three I would consider him one of my favourite characters, I\u2019d have likely pushed them out of the moon door. It\u2019s quite surprising that George R.R Martin actually changed him around like this. Well, I say change around. What I actually mean is showed the reader what he actually is. Never before, with any novel, have I had my feelings of pure hatred completely collapse in on them self and turn into pity and admiration. George R.R. Martin achieved this astonishing reversal by showing us the man as he saw himself. Instead of ignorant Ned Stark condemning him in his point of view, we see how Jaimie thinks. Indeed, we see his side of the story and why he committed his Kingslaying. It was no ill thought out act or cowardly murder; it was a killing of pure honour and decency. Surprising, I know. I was convinced by Ned Stark\u2019s judgment. I, too, saw a backstabber and murderer. I was glad when the veil was lifted because never before has a character been so wrongly perceived by so many. Jaimie Lannister, certainly, deserves more recognition for his act. But, like a man of honour, he kept the details to himself and cared not what the world thought. He knew that he exacted justice and that\u2019s all that mattered. Jaime reached for the flagon to refill his cup. \"So many vows...they make you swear and swear. Defend the king. Obey the king. Keep his secrets. Do his bidding. Your life for his. But obey your father. Love your sister. Protect the innocent. Defend the weak. Respect the gods. Obey the laws. It's too much. No matter what you do, you're forsaking one vow or the other.\u201d And then there\u2019s Tyrion\u2019s little fiasco with that crossbow. I mean, wow! I did not see that coming. I literally cheered the very first time I read that; it was so perfect and so necessary. The way the chapter ended was superb also. I\u2019d put the quote in, but that would be a big plot spoiler. I guess there is only so far you can push someone before they finally snap, and lash out against the world. Tyrion could only take so much abuse and disuse from the ones who should actually love him. What he did was totally justified and necessary for his own survival. He simply couldn\u2019t go on anymore with that kind of treatment. The end he provides to his victim\u2019s name will well, and truly, sully his reputation. It was most apt to finish him in such a way. What an awful, and deserved, way to go. Also, I think the blow of the red wedding has somewhat softened over the years. Initially, it is upsetting and horribly unjust, but then you read the build-up of it again and see it in a different light. It is clear that it was completely King Rob\u2019s fault. He caused it; he should have known better than to renegade on such an important deal. It was pure folly. He left himself completely vulnerable. But, he isn\u2019t to blame completely; he was very young after all. Maybe one day the Starks will be avenged completely. Well, I think it\u2019s obvious that there is only on person with the capabilities to do it. By this point in the series Dany has truly cast aside her fear. She has realised who she is and what she is capable of; she has become the dragon her brother was attempting to be. But, for all her power, she lacks wisdom. It isn\u2019t a lack of wisdom born of stupidity, but through a lack of experience. She needs someone to guide her and help her realise her destiny; she needs someone well versed in the game to lead her steps, and insure her politics are not completely detrimental. In short, she needs someone braver than Jorah and someone more cunning than Barristan; she needs a strong right hand. She needs an ally who can truly save her. It\u2019s just a shame that the television show has beat Martin to it! However, she still has her own natural leadership abilities. She has taken an army and freed a city; she has found her voice and her confidence. But, she still needs help. Dragons are a powerful weapon, though they will only take her so far. They\u2019ve saved her in this novel, and they will save her again. But, it takes more than Fire and Blood to win a throne, though it does help. This, for me, is the strongest novel in the series so far. The characters have evolved and become figures of investment. The characters in this are truly brilliant. It\u2019s why this series is so damn good. It\u2019s very difficult to actually pick a favourite because with each novel my opinions seem to change as the characters do. It\u2019s also very hard to give each of them a mention in a review! I didn\u2019t even talk about Jon Snow. Never mind. I think it\u2019s clear what my opinion of this book is. I do love this series! A Song of Ice and Fire 1. A Game of Thrones- A life chnaging five stars2.A Clash of Kings- An Impish five stars3. A Storm of Swords - A Lannister loving five stars 4.  A Feast for Crows - A flat 3.5 stars"}, {"Review": "Martin outdid himself. And honestly, he didn\u2019t have to try so hard. I was already going to give him five stars for this scene alone: (view spoiler)[THE RED WEDDING! I cannot believe the King of the North, Robb Stark was murdered! (hide spoiler)]Have you ever seen a car accident? Not the aftermath that messes up traffic, but the actual event itself? Having driven in both Atlanta and Houston\u2019s rush hour, I\u2019ve seen a handful. It\u2019s horrible horrible horrible. There is that signature sound when thousands of pounds of metal crunch together. And it blows my mind. One side of my brain is in denial and keeps repeating, \u201cThat did not just happen.\u201d The other half is moving forward. \u201cIs anyone hurt? Don\u2019t gawk \u2013 don\u2019t want to be rear-ended myself. Do they have the insurance? Has someone called the police?\u201d I get clammy and shaky, as well as teary-eyed thinking of all the emotions they\u2019ll have to deal with. And even though I wasn\u2019t directly involved, I have this on-edge feeling that lasts the whole day. Reading THAT scene was akin to watching a multi-car pile-up. I freaked out. Literally slammed the book shut, stood up on the bed, and cussed for a bit. Next I curled up into a ball, hugged the book to my chest, and muttered \u201cNo no no!\u201d on loop. I wailed to my concerned husband, \u201cWhat is going to happen now?\u201d Then I proceeded to mull over this development for days.Looking back, I wonder why it shocked me so much. This series is full of twists, deaths, and reveals. What\u2019s one more? And Martin certainly gave some clues leading up to the event. I think it caught me off guard, because he had just devoted a fair amount of time to this part of the plot. Through books one and two, (view spoiler)[I kept wondering why Robb is the only character of the Stark family who is largely ignored \u2013 except for Rickkon, but he\u2019s too young at this point to participate. (hide spoiler)] Truth be told, I ignored my own advice after reading book two: if you see a bright light, don\u2019t trust it. (view spoiler)[That was a nasty trick on Martin\u2019s part to make me empathize for a character only to turn around and murder them a few chapters later. The moment I thought, \u201chuh, I kind of like this Robb guy\u201d, I should have been on high alert. I was honestly expecting him to be taken prisoner at the Twins or fight off an attack. That Martin would actually kill this potentially great king never entered my mind. (hide spoiler)] I guess there is a new, supplemental lesson: never enter into a romantic relationship with Martin. He would jerk my emotions around mercilessly and leave me heartbroken on a bathroom floor.Also, THE scene made me question where this entire series is headed. Imagine you\u2019re reading a safe, mass-appeal book, you can rest assured that no how much hardship the author throws at the protagonist, they\u2019ll survive, because (a) the author/publisher doesn\u2019t have the guts to disappoint their legions of readers and (b) there\u2019s a sequel! I thought the main goal here was to see the Stark family emerge victorious and save the Seven Kingdoms. Now I\u2019m not as sure. And after reading roughly 3,000 pages and with 2,000+ pages to go, it shook me to feel so untethered. Anyways, kudos to Martin for making me react that strongly. I read enough that I am becoming increasingly callous to authors\u2019 surprise attacks. And this series is so large that the plots from each book are already melting together. It is hard to remember during which book this or that character was introduced or where I learned a key piece of information. But THAT scene will always define book three for me. I also love that when I felt confident the book was winding down (with only 200 pages to go), Martin threw in some more shockers. While they were not of the same caliber as THE scene, they nonetheless required me to reset my expectations for the next book. Of course I am referring to (view spoiler)[Stannis saving the Wall and, more importantly, the murder of Joffrey, Tywin, and Lysa. Hooray! I won\u2019t be missing any of them. It seemed uncharacteristic for Martin to kill off the bad guys. Yet I thank him from the bottom of my heart. The prospect of watching Sansa become the king\u2019s abused mistress or subject to her lunatic aunt was too much for me to bear. (hide spoiler)]Martin, I am catching onto your wily ways. And I am begging for more. "}, {"Review": "PREVIOUSLY, ON A SONG OF ICE AND FIRE: A ton of dudes came up out of the woodwork to fight over a stupid crown, lots of people died, lots of people killed lots of people, there was consensual sex and a lot more rape, some hookers and mercenaries, and life continued to be utterly terrible for anyone with the last name Stark. Also there are fucking dragons and ice-zombie-monsters, don't forget about those! It only gets more fun from here, boys and girls. So with that in mind, lets check in with our narrators this time around and see what they've been up to. They are:Arya Stark: God, I love this little girl. She goes full badass here, teaming up with The Hound and traveling the country with him like some crazy mashup of Pulp Fiction and Paper Moon. More than anyone else, I want Arya to make it to the end of this story, because she is so, so cool. Severely damaged and with zero chance of living a normal life after all the shit she's been through, obviously, but in Westeros you take what you can get. Catelyn Stark: Yes, this bitch is still getting to narrate chapters, and no, she will never be held accountable for the fact that 75% of all the shit that's happening in this book is all her fault. Early in the book, she decides to release Jaime Lannister and get Brienne to take him across the country and exchange him for Arya and Sansa (how many ways can this go wrong? I counted five, see if you can guess more!). Again - she helped her own son's most valuable prisoner escape, and set him loose with one woman to guard him. If anyone else had pulled that shit, their head would be rotting on a stake within five seconds, but because it's Catelyn Stark, all the men do is send her to her room to think about what she's done. And then they keep inviting her to council meetings, because that's certainly never backfired before! (view spoiler)[Honestly, I was almost relieved when Catelyn gets killed in this one, because at least now she won't be able to ruin anything else. But then of course the epilogue came, and I learn that nope, Catelyn's not dead! The one person who gets reanimated, and it has to be Catelyn Fucking Stark? Her? (hide spoiler)]Jaime Lannister: Finally, one of the Big Bads gets his own chapter! Unfortunately, it's not as fun as it could have been. Sure, every now and then he'll be like, \"Man I sure miss having sex with my sister\" or \"I absolutely do not regret pushing that kid out the window in Book One, that was awesome\", but for the most part Jaime actually experiences some personal growth and maybe becomes a better person. But apparently Cersei gets her own chapters in the next book, so I've already started making popcorn for that crazy cunt sideshow.Bran Stark: You're a warg, we get it. I don't care. Sansa Stark: Oh honey. You know the expression \"falling from the frying pan into the fire\"? Sansa does more than that in this book. She falls from the frying pan into the fire, and then falls again into an even worse fire that's much more likely to rape her. At this point, I almost want Sansa to die, just so she'd be put out of her misery - judging by what's happened to her so far, I don't see any way this series can end well for her. Also it'd be nice if she could stop inadvertently causing death and destruction.Tyrion Lannister: Oh Tyrion, how I love you. You are clever and sarcastic and funny, seem to have a shred of human decency, and are pretty much the only good person in the series. Just a piece of advice though: stop falling in love with prostitutes. Seriously, man. Otherwise, keep doing what you're doing. Davos Seaworth: Yeah, he's still around. His only purpose is to give us an idea of what Stannis is up to, but it basically boils down to this: \"Stannis is a deluded motherfucker, and Melisandre is a crazy bitch who's going to kill everyone.\" Got it, moving on.Samwell Tarly: When I got to his first chapter and realized that he was going to be a narrator in this book, I literally groaned aloud. Jon Snow: He's getting better, guys. After spending two books whining about how unworthy he is, he finally gets to be cool and go undercover with the wildings, and is sort of a badass by the end of the book. His undercover work, I should mention, involves sleeping with a wilding girl named Ygritte, and if there's one character who can be counted on to turn hot wilding sex into an excuse for another woe-is-me fest, it's Jon Snow. I mean, for Christ's sake, dude, you're a fifteen year old boy who's getting laid on a regular basis! Forget about your vows, you should be singing from the rooftops! Get over yourself and lighten the hell up, (view spoiler)[especially since you're probably actually the bastard child of Robert and Lyanna, so you're gonna have to deal with that sooner or later (knowing Martin, it'll be way later, and it's only a theory anyway so I wouldn't put too much stock in it) (hide spoiler)]Daenerys: So, all that stuff I mentioned up there? It's all important and takes up the majority of the book, but here's the thing: none of it matters, because Daenerys fucking Stormborn has dragons and an army, and she is coming to destroy everything. And I cannot wait. A final word: If there's one thing I've taken away from this book, it's that you should never go to a wedding in Westeros. Seriously, don't do it. There are three weddings in this book, and all of them end horribly. Stay home and send a nice card instead. "}, {"Review": "Three kings contend for the throne and King Joffrey's wedding day grows near. Can he hold the throne with Robb Stark and Stannis Baratheon nipping at his heels?Yeah, that's a woefully inadequate summary but it's not laden with spoilers, either.Here we are, the third installment of Weddings, Beddings, and Beheadings, and my favorite one so far. In fact, I was thinking about downgrading them to 4's just so I could show how great I thought this one was. Martin outdid himself this time.First of all, there were quite a few deaths in this one. I wasn't expecting Robb Stark to go out like that. Tywin and Joffrey more than had it coming, however. The Red Wedding was pretty surprising, as was the trial by combat for Tyrion's fate. Speaking of Tyrion, his wedding to Sansa was also quite unexpected. I'm still not sure where things are going with Davos Seaworth but I'm already itching to find out.Jon Snow continued to be my favorite character, from his stint with the wildlings to his defense of the Wall to his imprisonment and eventual election to commander of the Night's Watch. The prospect of Snow becoming Lord of Winterfell is an intriguing one and I'm anxious to see how it unfolds.Another plotline I'm particularly enjoying is that of Arya and the Hound. The Hound could easily be a scene-chewing villain but is a surprisingly deep character. Arya is shockingly bad ass for a preteen.One character I'm surprised I've grown to like is Jaime Lannister. He's an arrogant unapologetic bastard and I love him for it. I'd read a whole book of Jaime's exploits.Also, how about Petyr Baelish?

Many of these characters with good hearts and souls have such terrible things happen to them, while liars and killers prosper. Sometimes having a heavy pocketbook is more important than being a good person. *insert thought provoking parallel about how this mirrors our world and makes it even sadder*As always, I want to state a disclaimer, like with all of the books in this series, that there are many very graphic rape and gang-rape scenes. I couldn't even list all of the triggers for sexual abuse in this book, so please use caution when reading. As scary as the sexual violence is to me, I think it is very believable in this world and helps to show people that the real monsters aren't just beyond the wall; they are human beings capable of very evil things. \"To omit them from a narrative centered on war and power would have been fundamentally false and dishonest, and would have undermined one of the themes of the books: that the true horrors of human history derive not from orcs and Dark Lords, but from ourselves. We are the monsters. (And the heroes too). Each of us has within himself the capacity for great good, and great evil,\" GRRM even says (perfectly) himself, via The Guardian.I am loving this reread, and I'm loving being able to piece together theories that I completely missed in prior readings. Game of Thrones truly is the best show on television, and these books are truly a tier above the rest of high fantasy out there. I know they can be intimidating and a little dark, but they are so worth it. I can't recommend this series enough. GRRM is honestly a genius, and I'm still not sure if I'm worthy enough to read his words. The rest of this review will have spoilers from A Game of Thrones, A Clash of Kings, and also mild spoilers for this book, A Storm of Swords! If you have not read the first three books in this series, and do not want to get spoiled, please do not read this portion of my review!My favorite story-arc in A Storm of Swords is, hands down, no question, Jaime's. Jaime's story of redemption is honestly one of the best I've ever read. His actions truly are all \"for love\", he just starts learning what unconditional love is a little late in life. In this book, Brienne is on a mission, from Catelyn, to return Jaime to the Lannisters in hopes of getting her daughters back. Jaime's change is so apparent on this trip with Brienne. I think Jaime is also, probably, the most complex character in this world. I can't see him having a happy ending, but I hope his redemption story leads him to it, rather than death.\n\n\u201cI've lost a hand, a father, a son, a sister, and a lover, and soon enough I will lose a brother. And yet they keep telling me House Lannister won this war.\u201d\n\nTyrion is the other Lannister that gives me a lot of feelings. Tyrion is such an amazing metaphor on how the society we live in today treats people that look \"differently.\" His father will never accept him, his sister will never love him, and no one in the kingdom will take him seriously even though the kingdom is only standing because of him in A Clash of Kings. What a terrible hand he is constantly being dealt, and all because of his physical appearance that he has no control over. I want, so badly, for Tyrion to win the game of thrones.\n\n\u201cThe greatest fools are ofttimes more clever than the men who laugh at them.\u201d\n\nAnd thanks to Tyrion, we get to see more of a new and beloved character - Oberyn Martell. His pain and revenge mission was really inspiring and heartfelt. I wish we could have seen more of him, and Dorne (don't get me started on show Dorne, please), because he really was an amazing character, who deserved his revenge. Also, he had one of the best duel scenes I've ever read in my entire life. Again, GRRM is a god among men. \n\n\u201cRhaegar fought valiantly, Rhaegar fought nobly, Rhaegar fought honorably. And Rhaegar died.\u201d\n\nMy favorite character, Davos, and his points of view were a little painful this reread. Stannis is so out of his mind because of his need for power. He is legitimately upset because Robert was King, Renly ruled their home, and Ned got to be hand of the king. None of his actions are because he wants what is best for the realm. Seeing him being hurtful to Davos really upset me. The weird thing is, I like Melisandre and I think she is a great anti-hero, but Stannis just enrages me. I never understood the fan following he has. But that's okay, because Davos is my little cinnamon roll and I pray no harm ever comes of him. Especially because of all he has lost and endured in this book. Oh, poor Catelyn. I guess we can talk about her and how her story-line is, by far, the saddest in this book. Don't get me wrong, Catelyn has upset me very much with her treatment of Jon and her naive thinking in other books, but in this book I can't help but have an immense about of empathy for her. I am not sure I've ever reading anything like the Red Wedding. You can feel Catelyn's helplessness in a way I can't even put into words. Her desperation and her defeat are so palpable. I've never been a fan of Cat or her chapters, but this piece of literature breaks me every time. \n\n\u201cAll these kings would do a deal better if they would put down their swords and listen to their mothers.\u201d\n\nIf only Robb would have just listened to his mother. If only he would have been able to keep it in his pants for a night, or to not feel guilt afterwards. If only Robb would have stayed in Winterfell. I mean, I can play the \"if only\" game with Robb all day, but that doesn't make the results of what happened any different. Robb left Winterfell to avenge his father. Robb trusted himself over his mother. Robb is a grown man that wanted to have sex, and felt obliged to marry a girl after he took her virginity. I mean, it's not like he did terrible, unthinkable things, he did things that a young boy would do. It doesn't ease the pain, or make me less upset, but he actions are somewhat understandable. \n\n\u201cHe won the war on the battlefield and lost it in a bedchamber, poor fool\u201d\n\nAnd since the Red Wedding is much different from the show, is this going to be the last mention of Jeyne Westerling? I'm not saying consenting adults can't have sex, but she seemed a little manipulative, and so did her father and uncle (who Greywind didn't like). I'm excited to see if anything comes from the Westerling family down the road in this series.Sansa Stark is just getting passed around from one person to the next. I think she really embodies what it is like to be a high-born lady in this world. All she wants is her prince charming, because she has been fed promises of him her whole life, but all she receives is disappointment after disappointment, while counting her ever growing list of dead family members. Also, Littlefinger is gross.Arya, my favorite Stark, is still doing everything in her power to hide that she is a high-born lady in this world. Sometimes, I truly forget her age, but when I remember my heart bleeds all over again. She has endured so many things that I wouldn't wish upon my worst enemies, but she overcomes them all. Arya is super inspiring and motivating, to me. I hope her journey with The Hound isn't over, and the end result turns out like it did in the show.Rickon is nonexistent and Bran is, sadly, forgettable in A Storm of Swords. I'll be honest with you; Dany's story-line in this book is a little boring for me. All of my feelings just manifest to hate for Kraznys mo Nakloz, the slave trader Dany tries to bargain with. Seriously, he makes Joffrey, Cersei, and The Mountain look like saints! Any leftover feelings I had went to being creeped out about Jorah, and how he is such an old pervert. Like, I always thought the show portraying his love for Dany was so wrong. I know it's mostly because Emilia Clarke doesn't look thirteen, but still, Jorah is such a creep. Unfortunately, these two very dark clouds loomed over Dany's story, and made her chapters not as enjoyable as some of the other main protagonists in this book.\n\n\u201cI am the blood of the dragon. I must be strong. I must have fire in my eyes when I face them, not tears.\u201d\n\nSam had the other lackluster chapters, for me. Sam is one of the few characters I like on the show much more than reading about in the books. I know GRRM loves him, and I know his love for books will obviously play a bigger role in this story, but as far as A Storm of Swords goes, Sam was boring as hell. I mean, he's literally killing white walkers and still, somehow, being boring as hell doing it. I don't even understand. But, he did put Jon's name in the running for Lord Commander, so I can't dislike his character or anything. Lord Commander Snow. Oh, how my heart breaks for Jon over and over again, too. He's constantly trying to prove his worth to people who refuse to see it. I loved how he was able to actually experience happiness with Ingrid, even for just a short while. Also, I remembered them having sex, but I completely forgot how much sex him and Ingrid had. Holy shit, I so didn't remember reading that. Oh, Jon Snow. \nTHINGS I MISSED IN MY PREVIOUS REREAD(S):\nMance Rayder is Able, inspired by Bael the Bard, in A Game of Thrones - There is a story that Bael the Bard snuck into Winterfell and had sex with a Stark woman and impregnated her. Mance was inspired by this tale, and in A Game of Thrones a man named Able and a washer woman were very interested in Theon and Arya at the feast that Robert Baratheon attended when he finally made it to Winterfell. Well, this was because it was Mance and the spear wives/wildings in disguise, spying on what was going on in Winterfell! Maege Mormont and Tormund Giantbane are totally in love - I will come back to this in my review of A Dance with Dragons, but this book still hints at the fact that Tormund likes to \"sleep with a she-bear\", and Maege Mormont not only fits the description, but House Mormont's symbol is a bear. Tormund even has the title \"Husband of Bears.\" Tormund has wildlings sons, but they have no mother north of the wall, this could be because Tormund keeps the sons, so they will not be considered bastards. Maege could keeps all the girls, which, by the way, none of them have fathers, and Maege can still marry them off to live good lives under House Mormont. Also, this means Lyanna Mormont, who won everyone's hearts in S6, is one of their love children! Dreams are way more important than what they seem -  Alt Shift X just made an amazing video about some of Dany's dreams and how important their foreshadowing will be, but he has also made an Arya video a while back that really stuck with me this reread. Arya dreams and wargs in this book constantly, and her fascination with warging into Nymeria is such a big part of this book's story. Bran also wargs into Summer, missing how it feels to move on his own, but Arya's dreams really stuck with me and I think will play a much bigger role in her character's development. Also, Alt Shift X is amazing. Please, spam all his videos. If you're a ASOIAF fan, you will not regret it. I'm sorry if this review seems all over the place. I get so passionate about this series, and while writing I have like fifty different trains of thought going! I loved this reread, and I'm learning so much information I had previously missed. I always loved A Storm of Swords, because it seemed so action packed, while giving us this surprise ending that introduces one of the main themes that the show has chosen not to do - Lady Stoneheart.

Now he is dead.* Catelyn was a lordly lady with a loving, honorable husband and 5 beautiful children. Now she's a widow, her kids are all dead (or so she thinks), and she, also, is dead. Bonus: she's a zombie.* Sansa was an annoying, helpless, spoiled preteen. Now everyone she's ever loved is dead, but she remains annoying and helpless despite it all.* Arya was an endearing highborn tomboy. Now's she's a murderous urchin, but still endearing.* Jon was a bastard. Now he's a lord. But he's still a bastard.* Rob was a nondescript dude. He's still that, except now he's dead.* Bran was a little boy with two eyes who liked to climb. Now he's a slightly older little boy with three eyes who hangs out with frog-eaters, mind melds with animals, and is looking to get lessons from another three-eyed mind melder who might be undead.* Rickon was a side note. He remains so.I keep wondering whether these books are sexist or not, which usually boils down to the question of whether or not female characters have agency. I don't know if that's a reasonable test of gender bias, but that's where my mind goes. It's certainly true that most of the female characters rarely make decisions that influence the narrative, but I think that's equally true of the males. Some exceptions I can think of include Arya escaping Harrenhall, Catelyn freeing Jaime, Danaerys freeing slaves. Cersei, despite being one of the most overtly willful women in the story and the most vocal about gender bias in her society, seems to have little real power. She wanted to spare Eddard, he ended up dead. She wanted to save her kids, Joff ended up dead. She wants to marry her brother but her dad keeps wedding her off for political reasons.Another possible way to approach the issue might be to ask whether the books sanction male chauvinism. I don't think you can read these books and believe that men are intrinsically superior to women, because there are plenty of idiotic men and plenty of capable women. As I wrote in a previous review, I do think these books objectify women much more than they do men, which at the very least is distinctly gynophilic (a new word I just looked up!), and probably allows some hetero men and lesbians to indulge in fantasy that many women might find demeaning. That said, though, speaking as a heterosexual guy, I find most of the sex in these books to be more ham-fisted than arousing. However, I doubt Martin did that intentionally. I guess \"ham-fisted\" could qualify as arousing if you have some kind of ham fetish. Let's just stop talking about this. (hide spoiler)]Anyway, these are all comments on the series. This particular book was no better or worse than the previous ones, which is another way of saying it still kept me up reading until 2am most nights. I wish Martin would work in a few more comic relief characters like Dolorous Ed, though. Jaime and Brienne were good for a few laughs. More of that, please.I'm finding one of the most amusing parts of this series to be moments when I have to stop and wonder whether or not a sentence implies a fatality. Like, \"..and then a boulder fell on him.\" Did he say how big the boulder was? Where, exactly did it hit him, and who, exactly, is \"him\" referring to? Fun times. Also, am I the only one who looks ahead at chapter titles to see if a character really died? I know, cheating. "}, {"Review": "Gut reaction review:WTF!!!Post blown-gasket review:A Storm of Swords should be called A Storm of Suitors for all the matchmaking going on through out. I'm not complaining, mind you. It's all handled with a touch (or sometimes a bludgeoning) of intrigue to keep it interesting. Ah yes, the soap opera continues, and much of it this tome around is about who weds who in hopes of attaining which castle or what lands. The court intrigue of lords and ladies is good and all, but I doubt it would've kept me reading on if Martin hadn't added a little murder here and a bloody siege there. The magic-and-monsters aspect of this fantasy comes in a little heavier than it has in past books, too. I prefer my fantasy more grounded in reality, so this had me edging towards a hint of queasiness at times, but all told, it was nothing I couldn't stomach. Actually, one area where fantasy is strongest was one of my favorite parts. I absolutely rejoiced at finally seeing some real, meaty north of the Wall action! And Jon Snow (who knows nothing, btw) remains one of my favorite characters from the very start. One quibbling complaint: Martin dropped the ball once or twice in this book like I've never seen him do before. Characters need to be believable within the scope of the world they inhabit. If they are not, say if they act contrary to their own nature as previously displayed, we the reader stop following them, at least not with the same gusto. Such is the case involving (view spoiler)[Sansa. Her willingness to go with Ser Dontos and let him 'take her home' when she knew full well she had no home to go back to was Martin's false step in his effort to get Sansa into Little Finger's clutches. (hide spoiler)] It's forced and just plain sloppy.However, all that pales in comparison to one absolutely shocking moment (see original review...never mind, I'll just reprint it here: WTF!!!) that took me completely by surprise. I'm not saying it was a Martin-mistep, but I'm just coming around from my stunned stupor. In and of itself it would mean nothing to someone who hadn't read the first two books, but being fully ensconced in the soap opera as I am, it had great meaning....I'm really trying my hardest not to revert to spoiler masks here...so let me just say - it was like having the rug pulled out from under me, but then feeling some satisfaction upon learning that the same thing happened to my asshole neighbor - and I'll leave it at that. "}, {"Review": "DAMN!It\u2019s like if you buy a muscle car on Friday afternoon and you drive it home some friends come over to look at it and you know and they all know how cool it is. Then on the second day you get to drive it around town and everyone that sees it knows you\u2019ve got a beast, a low growl coming from under the hood. But it\u2019s not until the third day that you arrange to go out onto a track and open it up that you realize what a monster machine you\u2019ve got and even as the speedometer passes 100 you press down further and it responds like a galloping horse and keeps accelerating and you breathe catches in your throat and you know you\u2019re on the ride of your life. And you whisper: DAMN!George R.R. Martin knew he had something cool when he first published A Game of Thrones in 1996. Martin had been toiling away as a writer for more than twenty years and had seen struggles and poverty, as had many speculative fiction writers before him. While he had seen some success in his fantasy and horror stories and books, and had some work screenwriting, it was not until he set out to create this epic fantasy that his stock began to rise \u2013 his muscle car hit the nitro and fishtailed into wild success with the HBO adaptation and millions of golden dragons to line the coffers of his keep.A Storm of Swords, first published in 2000, his third in the series, is the muscle car, the biggest and fastest horse, the book where Martin, established as a success and had his readers\u2019 attention, put the hammer down to see what this thing can do.It\u2019s a wild ride. Fans of the first two books knew about Westeros and Essos and about the Starks and the Lannisters and the faded glory of the Targaryens; and they know about the raw carnality of the books, the guttural sex and violence that adds harsh realism to the story. ASOS takes it up a notch and demonstrates that as good as the series is, Martin can continue to make it a bionic man of fiction: faster, stronger and better.The violence. One of the criticisms of the 2004 Antoine Fuqua film King Arthur starring Clive Owen was the minimization of violence. Whereas earlier adaptions of the Arthur legend were intentionally theatrical and atmospheric rather than realistic, Fuqua seemed to be on to a cool angle by introducing a historically accurate revisionist story of Arthur as a Roman leader fighting Picts and Scots. There\u2019s swords and daggers and arrows and lots of fighting, but not so much blood and guts. The incongruity of the muddy realism with the stylized violence was distracting.Martin, on the other hand, takes the Tolkienesque legend, adapts it to fit on to his alternate War of the Roses inspired fantasy and does not leave out the brutal reality of war and survivalist feudalism. Razor sharp blades cut, people bleed and die, women get raped and slavery exists. In his zeal for a fantasy that also seems real, Martin shines a light on the good, the bad and the ugly and his narrative is far better for it.Martin\u2019s POV chapters highlights and exhibits his great talent for fully developed characterization. The players are complicated and there is a dynamic depth of relationships that is mesmerizing. His world building, adding detail and history to an already spectacular creation, continues to impress.There are several scenes that stand out: the Red Wedding, Daenerys at Astapor, Tyrions trial of combat between Gregor Clegane and Oberyn Martell, and many others that fill this thick tome and make it a page turner.This is the best one so far and I\u2019m already on to the next one."}, {"Review": "Lo he terminado pero me he demorado mucho m\u00e1s de lo que esperaba. Como me suele pasar con los libros que me gustan mucho; intencionalmente atraso la lectura todo lo que puedo porque NO ME LOS QUIERO TERMINAR.No s\u00e9 si ser\u00e1 mi favorito de la saga, pero 'Tormenta de espadas' hasta ahora ha sido el que m\u00e1s me ha hecho emocionar. Lo viv\u00ed intensamente desde la primera hasta la \u00faltima p\u00e1gina.'Juego de tronos' es un libro lento de introducci\u00f3n. Eso no le quita lo fascinante, pero es abrumador y denso. Entendible porque apenas te est\u00e1n introduciendo en un universo, personajes e historia vast\u00edsimas.'Choque de reyes' llega para romper un esquema que 'Juego de tronos' nos \"ense\u00f1\u00f3\". Nos muestra que no solo estamos ante un juego b\u00e9lico y militar de reyes, caballeros, mercenarios y bandidos. Si no que tambi\u00e9n nos adentramos a un mundo de fantas\u00edas, maldiciones, brujer\u00edas y magia.Es por eso que esta saga se reinventa con cada entrega; cuando crees que todo se ha dicho, llega algo y te rompe la cabeza... Y de paso el coraz\u00f3n.Eso pasa con 'Tormenta de espadas': conspiraciones, acci\u00f3n, traici\u00f3n, drama, sangre, revelaci\u00f3n, tragedia y fantas\u00eda. Muchas de las dudas que llev\u00e1bamos a cuestas durante las dos previas entregas, se resuelven aqu\u00ed. Pero tranquilos, que si cre\u00edan que ya todos los misterios se hab\u00edan revelado, PUES NO, que ac\u00e1 nos dejan mil m\u00e1s abiertos (y ese ep\u00edlogo que es para morir de angustia).De forma objetiva, 'Tormenta de espadas' es el libro m\u00e1s equilibrado de los tres de la saga: el drama, la acci\u00f3n, el crecimiento de los personajes, la fantas\u00eda, la narrativa, es que tengo que meter todo en el mismo saco porque todo est\u00e1 en las perfectas dosis. George R. R. Martin no tendr\u00e1 la narrativa m\u00e1s fascinante, pero su universo lo compensa. Cada nueva historia, cada nuevo nombre, cada nuevo giro, cada nuevo desenlace... Todo hace de Martin un GENIO. No puedo expresar en palabras mi admiraci\u00f3n por este sujeto. Es tanta su habilidad, que aunque tiene m\u00e1s de 5 perspectivas narrativas diferentes, ninguna pierde credibilidad. Todos sus personajes tienen una voz aut\u00e9ntica y cre\u00edble, pero sobre todo caracter\u00edstica: uno ya sabe que Jon habla desde el deber, que Jaimie desde el sarcasmo, Arya desde la valent\u00eda, Sansa desde el miedo, Daenerys desde el orgullo... etc.De forma completamente subjetiva, este libro contiene demasiada emoci\u00f3n para mi pobre coraz\u00f3n... Y eso fue lo que m\u00e1s am\u00e9 de \u00e9l. Me re\u00ed con Jaimie, grit\u00e9 con Tyrion, me angusti\u00e9 con Davos, llor\u00e9 por El Perro (Y MUCHO. Carajo, no saben como amo al Perro), incluso so\u00f1\u00e9 con Robb y Cat. El desarrollo y evoluci\u00f3n de los personajes es brillante; nadie es nunca igual y tu coraz\u00f3n queda dividido al igual que tu juicio. No tengo si no solo halagos para las mil y no s\u00e9 cu\u00e1ntas p\u00e1ginas que componen 'Tormenta de espadas', tanto as\u00ed que no tengo absolutamente negativo que comentar.Pero ojo, siempre lo he dicho. Me cuesta un mont\u00f3n ser impersonal con los libros que disfruto. Siempre que me topo en este tipo de situaciones, termino engrandeciendo hasta los defectos de los libros que amo. Esta saga no es para todo tipo de personas y de eso s\u00ed soy consciente, pero si t\u00fa eres ese tipo de persona que cree que 'Juego de tronos' es una lectura/universo adecuado para ti, adelante. No lo dudes. 'Juego de Tronos' y 'Choque de reyes' es solo una peque\u00f1a entrada para lo que te vas a encontrar en 'Tormenta de espadas'; y ni siquiera esos dos libros previos llegan a prepararte el coraz\u00f3n para toda la adrenalina que vas a sentir con este.Pero como ya dije, me es dif\u00edcil mantener la calma cuando se trata de hablar (y ya puedo afirmarlo con total certeza) de la que se ha convertido en mi saga favorita.5 estrellas y mi fervor infinito para este libro."}, {"Review": "\nSecond read on 19/03/2016 - 26/04/2016\nI haven't been reading as much as I would like to these days. Aside from this series, which is more of a commitment than anything else, I rarely reach for other books. Perhaps it's because I'm reading nonfiction, but I rarely feel enthusiastic about reading. So far the reading year hasn't been amazing. And I don't think it has to do with the books, but my inability to enjoy them as I used to. Nevertheless, I've noticed that all the books I've re-read recently, I've enjoyed even more than I did the first time.I saw the first episode of the new season of Game of Thrones on Sunday with my dad. Due to a horrific episode in the previous season, I had vowed to never watch it again. Unsurprisingly I decided to give it another chance. In all honesty, I feel as if the show is doing far better than the books regarding its plot. Yes, these books have altered my outlook on reading completely. They have changed my taste overall more than anything else has. Still, until the series is complete, I can't consider it a favourite. There are so many loose ends and no guarantee that they'll ever be tied off.The hope that Martin will complete the series before his death is contagious, but as time passes, I'm beginning to realise how completely unrealistic it is. The show has moved on and my hopes for a conclusion are gradually fading altogether. I sound pessimistic, I know. In all fairness, this is an excellent series and one I'd recommend to nearly everyone. It's absolutely worth the time spent and even the high probability that it will never be completed.I think I've mentioned it before, but reading these again has made me far more tolerant of the POV characters. Karl (my fellow buddy reader) only likes a few (Arya, Tyrion, and Davos), whereas I hardly have any I dislike. Perhaps Samwell, who's the character Martin says he himself resembles best. That explains a lot. The first time I read these I barely liked any of the characters, but now for whatever reason, I can appreciate most of them and it's sort of refreshing.I rarely make updates for these books like I used to and in my reviews I hardly discuss the plot. I apologise, but in the end I feel as if I'm enjoying it too much to make updates. There's too much to talk about to ever fit into one review, and that's disregarding any spoilers. Reading the first half of this book felt like a prison sentence. I didn't want to finish the series and was only doing so because Karl and I had agreed that we would. I never wanted to read a book again, and not because I didn't like books, but because things were a mess. My health for one. Stress from family, The whole not-going-to-college thing, etc. Things I haven't mentioned here and probably won't because I feel they're too dull to elaborate on. In the midst of all this I somehow found that I was able to escape again in the pages of this book. I feel like a lot have things have changed since the first time I read this, but my love for it remains. If anything, it's only increased.\nFirst read on 30/03/2015 - 13/05/2015\nIt's seven in the morning and I already have \nThe Bear and the Maiden Fair\n playing on repeat. I think I'm really beginning to appreciate this series. Each book so far has been better than the one before it. Martin's story, if ever he manages to finish it, may very well become one of my favourites.This book was darker than the other two, but this just made it all the more exciting. It feels like this is where things are finally starting to pick up. Some loose ends were finally tied off too, so that was good.The characters were amazing as always. The younger ones in particular are developing wonderfully. Daenerys and Arya are becoming stronger, Sansa wiser, and even Bran's chapters are improving. Some characters I'm not too fond of, but even Jaime isn't quite as bad as I thought him to be.From beginning to end, this book was as good as the stuff under Casterly Rock. I wish I could say more, and there really is so much more to be said, but I'm at a point in the series where practically anything can be seen as a spoiler.I'm pretty happy with myself though. I'm almost at the part in the series where the show is currently (the fifth episode of the fifth season). I didn't think I'd get here so soon, but here I am.I was considering taking a brief break due to the recent reading slump I've been suffering, but I started the series in December, so whatever the argument, it's a poor one. Onwards!"}, {"Review": "Several aspects of this book make me want to give it only one star, several push me to rate it closer to the opposite end of the spectrum. I give it just over three stars.On the one-star end:The writing style grates. Opening to a random page, I find \"green as the summer grass\" and \"caught between the hammer and the anvil.\" Opening to any other page would provide similar cliches. The book could be shortened without removing substance: long lists of knights names and heraldry may mean something to the author, but to the casual reader with no interest in memorizing the hierarchy of a fictional chivalric system, such lists only delay reading as I skim past them. I suppose I should at least be pleased that Martin appears finally to have learned the word \"crenel\" so that I no longer need to suffer through his repeated mentions of \"the gap between the merlons\"....Yet the writing style is nothing compared to the utter lack of subtlety and tact. What bothers me most about this book is Martin's repeated description of random murders and rapes, included for what I can only assume must be their presumed shock-and-awe value. Although I can appreciate Martin's ability to evoke such emotional responses as righteous anger, pity, and revulsion, I cannot help but think that the overall view of humanity he projects is far too negative. Epic works need sorrow, but they need joy as well, and A Song of Ice and Fire is far too long not to have some lasting joys. Any book of any worth carries with it a message; Martin's seems just to be \"valar morghulis,\" Ancient Valyrian for \"all men must die\" and hardly a message worth sending. On the four- or possibly five-star end:Martin does a wonderful job of characterization by switching to a third-person limited focus upon a new character with each chapter. Just when a character seems most demonized, Martin zooms in upon that character to explain his history and motivation. The inherent flaw to this technique is that to humanize one character's actions yet another character must be demonized. In the end, some characters such as Gregor Clegane and the Mad King Aerys must be left demonized without the reader ever getting a glance at a human side to them.Martin also creates several intriguing religions and passingly hints and a few philosophical quandaries. For example, he passingly touches upon the idea that fire is warmth and light, yet it destroys to create these, thus provoking questions about the goodness or evilness of its nature. Despite its flaws, the book makes me want to keep reading the series. I hope to see the characters, religions, and budding quandaries developed in greater depth in the next book. I hope, perhaps, that one of the characters may even come to the realization that although \"all men must die,\" it is equally true that all men must live. The fire may burn out, but first it burns."}], "Image": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1497931121l/62291.jpg", "Desc": "An alternate cover for this isbn can be found here.Here is the third volume in George R.R.
