{"Name": "Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince", "Image": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1361039191l/1.jpg", "Reviews": [{"Review": "\"Read Harry Potter!\" they said. \"It'll be fun!\" they said. \"Our childhood was built on Harry Potter!\" they said.WELL YOUR CHILDHOODS WERE ALL HORRIBLE. OMG WHAT IS THIS BOOK? WHAT IS THIS MESS I'M IN?? Excuse me, but that large salty lake where my life used to be is my tears. Yes, yes, this means I loved it. But SERIOUSLY. Nooooot okay. At the end there, especially, I couldn't put the audio down so I was wandering about my house in a blind daze listening instead.And because every human and their fluffy poodle has probably sensibly reviewed this book, BAH. I'm just going to make a list of things I loved and things I didn't. My Intense And Passionate LOVES:\u2022 Harry + Ginny = yes. I was dubious at first. Like I think romance is NOT JKR's strong point...plus when she gets to a romantic scene she ends the chapter. HHAHAH. ADORABLE. (Not that I minded, I just...I think she's not good at romance.) But omg, there was that moment after the Quidditch match??? YUP. You know what I'm talking about. Excuse me, my heart just ran around in circles screaming and shipping.\u2022 Hermione: I adore her, but...I gotta admit, she was a little bit too stuffy. BUT I STILL LOVE HER. I love her love for learning.\u2022 I also adore how sensible Ginny is. \u2022 Fred and George's joke shop gives life. Also death, probs, but liiiiife.\u2022 I am utterly in LOVE with the whole concept of Hogwarts. I mean, I think it's stupid that they have to write with a quill and ink (can't they just enchant the quill to write for them?) and they seem to get an excessive amount of homework, BUT. It's all so vivid and detailed and it literally feels like Hogwarts is A REAL PLACE. I totally get why people wail about their letters going missing. \u2022 Speaking of detail...me likey. I always felt inside the story.\u2022 Plus the audio book (narrated by Jim Dale) is GREAT. I totally recommend it. I think Hermione's voice had a tendency to sound like an insufferable goat, but I got used to it. Harry's voice was perfection. \u2022 I also particularly liked Harry in this book. I JUST LOVE HARRY. <3 He's snarky, but he's lost some of the angriness from bk 5. He's got snarky quips at the ready, but he's also intensely...good. Like he's just a really GOOD chap, who makes bad decisions but really means well. ZOMG. *flails about* He was definitely my favourite character in this book. \u2022 ALSO DUMBLEDORE WAS GREAT. I love Dumbledore and how he's always polite and kind and smiley. (view spoiler)[ CAN WE TALK A MINUT EHOW I'M NOT OKAY THAT HE'S DEAD?!??!?!? LIKE WHAT EVEN THE FLYING HECK OF BROOMS NEST TAILS. THAT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE. BUT IT SHOULDN'T. BECAUSE NOTHING MAKES SENSE. Dumbledore. no. Come baaaaaaaack. *breaks down into a mess* I am also intensely furious that his weakening himself to get the horcrux was useless. MAD. Okay? I AM MAD. Character deaths where they failed are the worst there are.  (hide spoiler)]My Intense and Passionate LOATHES:(Hhahahha...you ready for this?)\u2022 Okay so, question: WHY do they sometimes go places and buy food...and sometimes they just magic it? Like Mrs. Weasely magics onion soup out of nothing for Harry. But in the next chapter, Harry and Ron are peeling sprouts. LIKE WUT. This makes no sense to me. \u2022 Why didn't Dumbledore pour the evil potion on the ground instead of drinking it? Just wannna know...\u2022 How the FLYING FRIKKIN BROOMSTICKS can anyone possibly convince me Snape is still on the good side? Because I don't even care. He can go abra kadabra himself to Timbuktu and DIE THERE THANKS. There is no repentance after this. I don't even care what the \"reason\" is in book 7, but Harry: you are an idiot to name your kid after Snape. \u2022 I HOPE SNAPE DIES.\u2022 DID I MENTION MY HATE FOR SNAPE YET???????\u2022 Oh and another thing...I am so angry at Snape arghhhqqwqq.\u2022 Okay. Good now. I'm calm. Thank you. \u2022 HAHHAHHAHAHTE SNAPE.\u2022 Yes, I truly am calm this time. I'm good.\u2022 So. I also am fairly annoyed about Voldermort's (Tom Riddle) backstory. Because he read like he was straight out of a psychopath text book...which I found monstrously unimaginative. Attractive, calm, subtle bully, kleptomaniac, limited emotional reach, charmer, smooth...blah blah. Yes. I can just read a book about psychopaths and that's Voldey's description. I wish there'd been a little more ingenuity in there.\u2022 I really also dislike Ron. I KNOW. Travesty. But he's a bully! He was bullying first year's the whole time...turfing tem off chairs, scaring them, bossing them around, taking stuff off them in the name of \"prefect\". Like how is that good?? How is that okay??? I will not forgive Ron for all this. And also the fact that he's a downright BRUTE to Hermione. How can I ship them when he's so rude and demeaning to her?? I DON'T. Hermione deserves better. And I don't buy the \"She completes him by sorting him out\" because I think all humans should take responsibility for their actions. Hermione shouldn't HAVE to force Ron into a better person and be his conscious. AGH. \u2022 Not shipping that. ^^\u2022 Okay, I'm done. But just *whispers* I hate hate hate Snape. So basically YES, I had a fantastic time with this book. I loved the audio. I loved the story. I loved Harry and the world just feels so big and rich and visual. I get the intense fandom for this I DO GET IT. After being so angry and 1000% done in with book 3, I can successfully say I can't WAIT to read the last book now. And then watch all the movies. And then I'll finally be caught up, omg. Only took me like 10 years. "}, {"Review": "I was first introduced to Harry Potter in a Children\u2019s Lit class in college. I had resisted this popular phenomenon until I was forced to pick it up for a grade, and Book 1 was short enough that I could read it in the course of 2 hours. I have to admit I wasn\u2019t impressed to any extent, nor did I dislike the experience, but I was critical on grounds of its being derivative, even if reading the first led to reading the second. After all, if I was bored and looking for something light, I could do worse than a fantasy about a child wizard who fights evil with his friends. But it was really the third book, with its increasing darkness, that took me in and made me a fan. With a movie coming out for Order of Phoenix and Deathly Hallows on the horizon, I decided I would reread Half-Blood Prince. I figured it would take four sittings, of course, with its 600 pages, but time does fly when reading this one, and I\u2019ve come to the conclusion that this is my favorite so far. What I wouldn\u2019t have been willing to admit in college that I\u2019m perfectly comfortable saying now is that J.K. Rowling is a fantastic storyteller; she writes with great clarity, wit, and humor; and she\u2019s created a cast of loveable characters with whom most people, due to the common experience of growing up, can relate closely. That said, the reason for my preference for the 6th book is that it\u2019s the most emotionally rich in the series. Here we get the backstory of Voldemort (*spoiler alert*) through a series of flashbacks (coming in HP by way of magically extracted memories), and in this way, we come to understand the villain\u2019s similarities and differences with our hero. After all, the villain has to have reasons for committing heinous acts, and until now, we don\u2019t know what these are.Voldemort is from a once-powerful wizard family reduced to poverty that lives in a dilapidated hovel on the edge of a small town, wary of outsiders, and their main point of pride is their pure blood, the lineage having cross-bred for generations so as not to pollute the line. Voldemort\u2019s mother lives with her father and brother and yearns for the love of a nonmagical man (\u201cmuggle\u201d in this world) and when her father and brother are arrested, she uses the opportunity to bewitch her beloved and run off. She ends up pregnant, the man deserts her, and she dies while giving birth to her half-wizard, half-muggle son, thus making him an orphan (like Harry).(Faulkner anyone?)But whereas Harry comes to Hogwarts and befriends Ron and Hermione creating unity and strength through positive emotions, Voldemort, when growing in the orphanage shuns other children, torturing them at times (without the awareness of adults) and stealing their possessions. What fuels him is his hatred of his beginnings, his mother\u2019s weakness at having died like a common person despite being a witch, and the \u201cmuggle\u201d blood inherited from his father. Over the course of his time at Hogwarts, Voldemort, charming as only evil can be, learns to win over people as a means to an end and disguise his insidious purposes, but he never befriends anyone. He moves, through his hatred, further away from many of the emotions that drive Harry, namely the desire to protect the people he loves and avenge his parents\u2019 death.With Dumbledore\u2019s help in exploring Voldemort\u2019s past, Harry begins to understand that he\u2019s come to be where he is through the choices he\u2019s made, that his greatest strengths are an alliance with his friends, and that this might hold the key to destroying his enemy, a fact that\u2019s made all the more poignant when Dumbledore, in an all-out assault on Hogwarts by Voldemort\u2019s Death Eaters, is killed at the end. The stakes are higher than before, the action and pace increase as the conclusion draws near, and things are looking darker than ever, which is the setup that any fan wants when the end is looming and it leaves us with the question: How will our hero prevail?"}, {"Review": "I'm not sure why, but this one took me completely by surprise. I was expecting this installment to be mainly filler to get us to the Deathly Hallows, but so much happened here that I must have forgotten from the movie. The Half-Blood prince was considerably darker than the previous 5 books, and I just adore how this series has progressed and grown just like most of its readers have. Obviously I knew what the big reveal was prior to finishing the book due to my viewing the films before, but it didn't take away from the experience the novel had to offer. I have this nervous lump in my throat knowing that the next book is the final one, but am simultaneously excited to finally read what the films surely have left out surrounding the conclusion of the series. "}, {"Review": "Re-Read in December 2014 for Harry Christmas To YouThis is DEFINITELY one of my top favorite books in the series. Shit just gets so real.My thoughts:-Dumbledore is so FREAKING sketchy in this book! He's so secretive, and he's always sneaking around, not explaining anything to Harry.-I'm always so proud of Fred and George for getting their own joke shop... I don't know what it is, I just feel like a proud mom.-ALL OF THE TOM RIDDLE BACKSTORY. THE GAUNT HOUSE. OMG. I literally need a whole book about Tom Riddle's life. That would make me happy.-While reading this book, there were about a hundred times when I was just amazed by irony at the whole Snape/Half-Blood Prince situation. (Harry is always going on about how great the Prince is and how terrible Snape is, etc.) I loved it!-\"Tom used to collect trophies,\" said Dumbledore, \"This will be important later.\" WHY COULDN'T HE HAVE JUST EXPLAINED HORCRUXES TO HARRY THEN? COME ON MANNNNN.-the fact that Voldemort went back to Hogwarts to ask for a job just.... is hilarious to me. I'm picturing a sort of weird looking Tom Riddle like \"plz. im evil but i luv hogwartz\"-when you find out that the Defence Against the Dark Arts job is actually cursed *thumbs up*-\"I love you, Hermione.\" RON ACTUALLY SAID THOSE WORDS. HE SAID THEM AND MY HEART SANG. He meant it in a friendly way but Hermione definitely loved hearing it.-Harry and Ginny are both so sassy and I love it when they become sassy together <3-at the end when Hagrid said something along the lines of \"Dumbledore will be able to fix it\" right after Harry saw him die.... Saddest thing ever.This book and its movie are definitely up there on my favorites list."}, {"Review": "Since pretty much everyone I know has read these books, I figure reviewing them is pretty pointless. But with the new book coming out in a couple of days, I have to go through them beginning to end. To make the reviews more entertaining, I will be doing them in a variety of unexpected formats.

I'm not proud...."}, {"Review": "\u201cI am a wizard, not a baboon brandishing a stick.\u201dHarry Potter is my life. My life is Harry Potter. Once again there are so many great and amazing scenes and quotes pressed between these pages, so much truth and emotion. How could it not fall for it again and again and again.Some of my favourite scenes (in no particular order):-Fleur and Mrs. Weasly falling into each others arms crying (just thinking about it makes me teary)(but no, really: Fleur is such an amazing and slightly underrated character. She lives with the Weasleys, where, honestly, no one makes it easy for her. Molly is fighting a constant battle with her but Fleur doesn't back off. Everyone is convinced she is vain and arrogant, but it's that moment in the hospital wing where - finally - these two amazing women recognise each other as equals, where Fleur gains acceptance and much more than that: respect. Everyone expected her to leave Bill for selfish reasons, no one expected that she really, truly loves him. But by proving that she would stand by him, whatever might happen - and everyone knew bad things were going to happen - she opened Molly's eyes and Molly saw her, for the first time, for what she really was. A strong and fierce woman and wife, as she was herself.)-the Memories: Dumbledore at the orphanage, Tom Riddle visiting Hepzibah Smith and Voldemort coming to ask for the DADA teaching job.-\"The Other Minister\" is one highly interesting and funny chapter.-Dumbledore's visit at the Dursley's-Utter silence before Hermione accidently punches herself with a telescope.-Ginny finally getting more spotlight, being the sassy and talented witch she is-Hermione pretending to go out with Cormac just to make Ron mad-\"I expect your trainers are too small, Won-Won,\" said a voice behind them and Hermione stalked past, smirking.-Ron's love potion episode-Harry unknowingly discovering you-know-what while hiding his Potions books in the Room of Requierement.-Professor Trelawney actually predicting the right stuff just to dismiss it as rubbish-\"This is Mr Dumberton- sorry, Dunderbore. He's come to tell you - well, I'll let him do it.\"There are some scenes however, that I do not like to read, where I have to stop myself from skipping them. Firstly, the dreadful second Quidditch match, secondly the Sectumsempra scene with Malfoy and Snape, thirdly Dumbledore suffering in the Cave. They are not very enjoyable.Something that will forever annoy me is how absolutely no one believes Harry's Malfoy-is-a-Death-Eater theory. He keeps telling Ron and Hermione about it but they ignore him.And then again, do you really expect me to believe that the brightest witch of her age would only get and \"Exceeds Expectations\" on her Defence Against The Dark Arts O.W.L.? Nope. Doesn't make sense. Especially not after Dumbledore's Army.In a nutshell: I love Harry Potter. Not sure I mentioned that before.Find more of my books on Instagram"}, {"Review": "Reminder that all of my Harry Potter reviews contain unmarked spoilers, and lots of \u2019em. If you\u2019re one of the two people on Goodreads who hasn\u2019t read this series, this review is not for you. So, my dear underside-of-a-rock-residing friends:https://emmareadstoomuch.wordpress.co...This review will be interesting, because this book was far (far, far) from perfect, and yet I am utterly determined to give it 5 stars. (Which I have only given to the first book in this series.)God, how do you talk about this book? It\u2019s really amazing. It is really hard for me to feel anything while reading a book or generally living my life. For example, I felt nothing when Sirius died. Nothing throughout most of this series, actually. And nothing in this book, because nothing happened and everyone survived and everything is sunshiney and joyful!Ugh. I tried. The last hundred-ish pages of this book really tore me apart. Okay, even that\u2019s not true. I\u2019ll just come out and say it: I\u2019m really f*cking sad that Dumbledore died. I love him so much. He\u2019s high up in my top 5 characters. (Do I even have a top 5?) I\u2019m devastated, which makes me even more upset, because I have a life to live today and can\u2019t just lay around and wallow in fictional pain.I\u2019m going to move on in the hopes that I just. Forget. Because I don\u2019t like this at ALL.Here, we see Harry Potter - who, I think few will argue, has been a fairly mediocre character up to this point - become AMAZING. He\u2019s motivated solely by his need to work against injustice and evil. He realizes his parents\u2019 legacy within himself. He denounces the sucking up of others. He works hard in school! He is a good friend even when his two BFFS are being childish to one another plus refusing to believe him. In short, he\u2019s really, really, five-star-level great here. Gorgeous character development in 650 pages.I didn\u2019t think I liked Ginny much, because I didn\u2019t remember this book well...like, at all. But she is so great! So funny. I wish there was more of her in this book.Also, I\u2019ll fight anyone who says Dumbledore is ~the real villain~ of this series. He\u2019s really not. (Cough, Snape is, cough.) AND YOU'RE NOT EDGY, PEOPLE WHO HATE DUMBLEDORE BUT LOVE SNAPE. YOU'RE JUST DUMB. I fell deeply in love with the guy. (Dumbledore, not Snape. BLEH.) AND I F*CKING MISS HIM. Goddamn it. Trying to forget didn\u2019t last very long. Anyway.I missed Hermione and Neville. Hermione was absolutely not well-represented here at all. Maybe it\u2019s a good thing she\u2019s not a Ravenclaw (#RavenclawPride) because she works fully against logic throughout this book. And when she\u2019s not she just, like, refuses to believe Harry.Ron is soooooooooo annoying! Is he anyone\u2019s favorite character? He\u2019s like, Fred or George if one of them was totally childish and attention-starved and mean. In fact, Ronald is a pretty impressive character for the number of gross character traits he embodies despite being supposed to be a good character. Mean, immature, rude, jealous, definition of an inferiority complex. Bleh.Harry and Ginny I\u2019m totally for, BUT THE OTHER RELATIONSHIPS IN THIS BOOK ARE SO BORING. Can we do Hermione and Fred instead? Ron and Luna would be cute. Or, God forbid, some LGBT representation? WE KNOW YOU\u2019RE A SUPPORTER, JOANNE. Don\u2019t even get me started on Lupin and Tonks.Speaking of supposedly-good characters\u2019 downfalls: I\u2019m no longer a Hagrid fan. It started with the last book and came fully around here. Like, at a certain point, the man needs a character trait. Liking weird animals, making bad food, and being humongous don\u2019t count. Harry and Hermione\u2019s constant stubbornness is annoying. Plus makes the plot repetitive once in a while. Also, Tonks. You know what, I guess I AM going to get started on Lupin and Tonks! She was a hilarious badass in the last book, totally depressed and weak in this one. I know I sound like a total emotionless asshole here, but that\u2019s who I am, and she\u2019s annoying in this book. AND IT\u2019S TOTALLY FINE BECAUSE SHE\u2019S JUST BEING A SPINELESS IDIOT OVER SOME DUMB SHABBY MAN. Kill me, please. Then I can see my beloved Dumbledore again.Too much Snape. (Cannot WAIT to write the rant on him.) Too much Draco. (Why do people romanticize that little weirdo so much? I guess I get the temptation, but he\u2019s a bully at best and a spineless traitor at worst.) I hate Kreacher and I hate Dobby...I hated Winky, too...I might hate house elves. If that makes me racist against a species of fictional character, SO BE IT, I GUESS.I miss Fred and George, and the fun people from the Order (if they existed), and Hermione and Neville aren\u2019t here nearly enough. The price of Harry\u2019s amazing and concise character development is WAY too many bad characters, not nearly enough of the good ones. EXCEPT DUMBLEDORE. UGHHHH. I\u2019M SO SAD. (I think my inability to cry is making this worse. Maybe if I just creepily sobbed in front of my roommate for a few minutes I\u2019d feel better. Damn you, my lack of emotions! Just kidding love you.)But I want to give this book five stars more than anything. It was so compulsively readable, more than any other book since the first for me. And it\u2019s the last book where our pals are attending Hogwarts. That makes me so sad. It\u2019s such a gorgeous setting and I\u2019m going to miss it so much. WHY IS THIS BOOK SO SAD?! If Deathly Hallows is any sadder I\u2019ll be seriously impressed. And also seriously screwed.And, okay, even though I was a harsh critic of these books...I\u2019m really going to miss this series. I\u2019ve been rereading it on and off (obviously) for three months, and it\u2019s been a fun ride. This is one of the greatest settings of all time. And since I\u2019m rereading it after 10 years, it\u2019s like saying goodbye twice. AND I HATE ENDINGS.Bottom line: Okay, THIS is my favorite Harry Potter book. (Anyone else\u2019s?) Unreal character development + tragic and lovely adieu to a gorgeous setting + ability to make me feel real, deep emotion + compulsively readable? An absolute dream.----------ORIGINAL REVIEW---------------Ron and Hermione's will-they-won't-they is a total snoozefest. I propose Fred & Hermione and Ron & Luna instead. Also seven more books!"}, {"Review": " Buddyread with the cutest Trixi.*sniffs* I have actually finished this several days ago but I spent those days mourning for the loss of one of my favorite characters of all time and before I start bawling my heart and eyes out again, let me straight away proceed to the random thoughts while and after reading the book. *sniffs* 1. *Gasps* Professor Snape???2. Harry\u2019s Quidditch Captain! Yaaas!3. Weasleys\u2019 Wizzard Wheezes (Say this ten times)4. Malfoy\u2019s head on Pansy Parkinson\u2019s lap and Pansy stroking his head. *shudders*5. Slughorn\u2019s belly preceded him out of the door. Bahaha6. Potions class has never been this cheerful. Thanks Grampy Sloghorn and Harry has never performed better. Thanks to cheating. Lol.7. Ron, you bollocks! Stop being an idiot, WonWon!8. Voldemort as a student seems to me even more sinister than the Dark Lord he already is. *shivers*9. Like Harry, I am Dumbledore\u2019s man through and through. Take that, Rufus!10. I\u2019d go back to school anytime if it meant having Professor Dumbledore as a teacher. 11. Aherm! Why do you keep looking for Ginny, now Harry?12. There\u2019s a reason a Dark Arts teacher stays only for a year. It\u2019s all clear now.13. Who would have thought that the once timid Ginny will blossom into a confident, beautiful, charming, funny and best of all, snarky girl?14. Chapter 24 will particularly make you swoon! Gaaah! (view spoiler)[ I ship Harry and Ginny! <3  (hide spoiler)]15. RIP, Aragog.16. For the first time, I solved the mystery! (view spoiler)[ I have guessed early on in the story that the Half Blood Prince was Snape! Yaaas! (hide spoiler)]17. I knew there was a reason Harry spent so much time with Professor Dumbledore. I can\u2019t\u2026*sobs* Some of the things/characters missing in the movie: 1. Kreacher and Dobby2. Bill and Fleur3. Dumbledore\u2019s Army and the Order of the Phoenix putting up a fight against the Dark Eaters.4. . Harry breaking up with Ginny which reminds me of Peter Parker and Mj. Finally, as a simple tribute to the wisest, kindest, most revered and one of the most powerful wizards (whose death out of the many deaths hurts me the most that I cried so much, I may have cried harder than Hagrid), the following is a collection of a few of his great thoughts and words that\u2019ll be forever etched in our hearts. *sniffs*  \u201cIn fact, being-forgive me- rather cleverer than most men, my mistakes tend to be correspondingly huger.\u201d  \u201cPeople find it a lot easier to forgive others for being wrong than being right.\u201d  \u201cIt does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live.\u201d  \u201cWords are, in my not-so-humble opinion, our most inexhaustible source of magic. Capable of both inflicting injury, and remedying it.\"  \u201cThe pain is part of being human. The fact that you can feel pain like this is your greatest strength.\u201d  \u201cTo the well organized mind, death is but the next adventure.\u201d  \u201cIt\u2019s not really goodbye after all.\u201d On a lighter note, it's beautiful Katerina's birthday today, let's spare a few moments to greet her a HAPPIEST BIRTHDAY!

I like Bill so much. he is so cool with his red long hair. maybe I didn't like Phlegm because I was jealous hahahaha okay it is not maybe, I was jealous. but look at this scene : ''E is always so thoughtful,' purred Fleur adoringly, stroking Bill's nose. Ginny mimed vomiting into her cereal behind Fleur. Harry choked over his cornflakes and Ron thumped him on the back.ugh ... how could I like her if she acted like that?!? that was really annoying and Ginny also found it disgusting. Hermione and Ginny didn't even like her. but she changed my mind on the the end of this book because when Bill was attacked by ... that werewolf guy who bit Remus when he was a kid. Bill is no longer as handsome as he used to be but Fleur still loves him. she doesn't care about how he looks and I even thought she would leave him after he was attacked but she didn't and that time I changed my mind about her. She is the right girl for Bill, even though I am a little bit jealous hahaha xD\nRon and Hermione\nI ship these two so much and I really really like Ron. Ron and Hermione are always funny. they always bicker about something and I think the first time Ron fell in love with Hermione was on the book four because he was so angry when he knew Hermione went to the Yule Ball with Viktor Krum and in this book Ron hurt me so much. He thought that Hermione kissed Krum and he was so angry and jealous because of this and he kissed Lavender in the common room that was full of people and it also broke Hermione's heart. Harry looked into the corner she was indicating. There, in full view of the whole room, stood Ron wrapped so closely around Lavender Brown it was hard to tell whose hands were whose.I remember very clearly that I cried so much till my eyes were red and puffy and that time I kept saying that I hated him and I didn't care about him but saying that seemed useless because I kept crying and crying. That time I wanted to hurt Ron's heart too, I wanted him to feel the exact pain Hermione felt when she saw him kissing Lavender. 'Er - my - nee,' croaked Ron unexpectedly from between them. but all my anger was gone when he was poisoned and he said that while he was asleep. I think he was trying to say Hermione, so that meant he dreamt about her and I forgave him that exact time and he also didn't really like Lavender anymore since then. he even pretended to be asleep when Lavender came to visit him in the hospital wing. so that meant he didn't like her anymore and I don't think he actually liked Lavender before he was poisoned. I think he just kissed Lavender because he wanted to make Hermione jealous and feel hurt, which he successfully did. \nHarry And Ginny\nhave you ever thought why Ginny had relationship with quite many guys? wait ... not many guys because she just dated two boys, Dean and Michael. But she always got a boyfriend as soon as she split up with her ex and my thoughs about this is probably right because Ginny said this to Harry on the end of the book  'I never really gave up on you,' she said. 'Not really. I always hoped ... Hermione told me to get on with life, maybe go out with some other people, relax a bit around you, because I never used to be able to talk if you were in the room, remember? And she thought you might take a bit more notice if I was a bit more - myself.' I think Ginny always dated a guy as soon as she split up with her ex because she always tried to forget Harry, so maybe if she had a boyfriend, she wouldn't love Harry anymore. But according to what she said she never really gave up on Harry so that means she has always loved him. I was a bit sad when Harry said they can't be together again because Harry was afraid if something would happen to Ginny if they kept seeing each other. he was afraid if Voldemort used Ginny to get him. but I didn't angry with him because this just proved how much Harry loves Ginny and I am sure they will be together again. I hope so ... \nDumbledore's death\nI admit that Dumbledore is not one of my top favorite characters in this series but I always found him funny and a bit weird, in a good way, of course. But his death left me in shock because he was actually pleading to Snape but Snape killed him with The Avada Kedavra curse and I thought Snape was on the good side. What will happen now after Dumbledore died?! He is the only one Voldemort is afraid of. I have this feeling that I'll to lose my favorite characters again ... thank you so much for reading and liking my review. hope you all have a great weekend, guys!

Pity the living, and, above all those who live without love.\"Albus Dumbledore is by far one of my favourite characters. He is clever, kind, badass, but most of all, he is weird. And I like weird. I like the way his first-day-of-the-year speeches make no sense at all. I like how he uses different types of candy for his office passwords. I like how he says he sees a new pair of socks in the Mirror of Erised. I like how he believes Harry unconditionally, no matter how farfetched his story may seem. He\u2019s been a guide, a counselor, a friend, not only to Harry, but to everyone Albus cared about. He\u2019s been a shoulder, a rock, some form of hope to everyone who had the privilege to be a part of his life. Everyone looked up to him. The darkest wizard of all time feared him. Yet he never looks dangerous. He is always this calm, serene person with a smile on his face, entertaining us with his wise, often odd sayings. He never put himself first; always thought of others. And even after his death will he be a beacon of hope, of faith, of everything the good side represents.Professor Dumbledore, I will always be loyal to you.

I've never expected Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince to be dark like this, but I liked it anyway. The boy from book one has grown up and makes a decision that turns out to be disastrous. The thing I loved about this book might be when Harry and Dumbledore dig into Voldemort's memory. We get to know about him and what kind of person he was before he became the Dark Lord. This is exceedingly fun !\n\u201cDumbledore says people find it far easier to forgive others for being wrong than being right.\u201d\nI really enjoyed many parts of this book, yet the last few chapters tore my heart out and crushed it into the ground. The development of these characters is surprisingly good too. It seems everyone has their way to deal with the problems. Harry and Hermione are perfect together, but not in the romantic way. The climax blew my mind and I didn't want to do anything more than sobbing quitely on the pillow. J.K. Rowling did a good job when she started writing this book, she knew how to unify the pieces scattering around these six books.\n\u201cVoldemort himself created his worst enemy, just as tyrants everywhere do!

With Lord Voldemort on the loose things are going very bad in wizard community; all the troubles spill in the Muggle world. Unsurprisingly the book begins with a chapter with real Muggle Prime Minister - somewhat unnecessary I might add. If you think you can find anything original in this review you are sadly mistaken. It is practically impossible to find anything new to say after literally everybody and their brother read and discussed the series. Still it was interesting to see some people try to pretend everything is fine and perfect (Hermione and Ron firmly fall into this category) while others like Harry being obsessed with suspecting other people - in Harry's case his suspicions of Draco Malfoy made him practically paranoid and acting retarded at times. Some spoilers follow. Is it still possible to find anybody who have not read the series or watched the movies? If you are one of such rarities, stop right here!!! Harry and Ginny romance came out of nowhere and feels very artificial. My old cynical self does not think Ginny is a good match for Harry. Why would anybody want to have a girlfriend whose only positive quality is to throw hexes around - for little or no reasons I might add? Hermione on the other hand was always there for Harry. Another complaint is fairly big and I will use spoiler tags for it. The underground lake scene: (view spoiler)[this came out really stupid for me. You had to drink the liquid to get the locket? You could not just reach it with you hand, fine. You could scoop the water with a goblet? Why not pour it out instead of drinking?  (hide spoiler)]Yet another big one: Snape (view spoiler)[Now that I know what is going on reading the second chapter I quite agree with Harry: he is probably the bravest man of the series. (hide spoiler)]The tragedy at the end still feels like a read tragedy during the reread while the impact of what happened at the end of the previous book considerably lessened when I read it the second time. So all the nitpicks aside I still rate this book with a perfect rating; it is well worth it. P.S. I always wanted to say it in one of the reviews for a book of the series; this feels like a good place: when it comes to movies, Richard Harris beats the crap out of Michael Gambon as Dumbledore. I am not questioning the acting abilities of the latter, but the former suited to the role much better.

Their development is very well done - it's realistic and believable.This book explores a lot of Lord Voldemort's past, which was great, because you learn so many things that make this character even more interesting. The way these flashback scenes were integrated was so well done and perfectly fit into the story.

The stillness that accompanies sitting with your own thoughts during the countless rest days is painstakingly growing on me, so I needed something to look forward to, other than the many family-talks speculating about what's ahead.I'm giving myself permission to sidetrack first into a bit of a backstory, given that this book did the same with its\u00a0rather long \"Previously on Harry Potter\" starting point,\u00a0catching the reader up on the 411.Back in late 2014 -\u00a0THE year I started reading Harry Potter for the first time and the same year I promised myself I'd finish the series - I made the hefty mistake of picking up the fifth book, \n  \n    Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix\n  \n, from the library on its own right before Hanukkah, meaning that the sequel wouldn't be available for another week. I then dutifully devoured the fifth book by day two and convinced my mom that the only thing I wanted, nay needed, was the sequel, which I promptly completed in time to take the finale from the library.(Spoilers: I finished the series with two days to spare of 2014 in which I also finished\u00a0To All the Boys I\u2019ve Loved Before\u00a0to provide me some of that lightheartedness, as I mention in my review.)I personally had a rocky start with reading the series. The first book took me multiple times to pick up and complete; it took me months of what I usually read within a week. I remember now really getting into the series with the fourth and fifth book, though I can't recall now which works better in my favor.\n    Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix\n  \n\u00a0is probably my favorite because I'm a sucker for dreams and nightmares being interpreted and taken seriously. The minute you start paying attention that's when you start seeing more clear signs that can easily give answers to your own personal situation.This sixth book seemed promising to me, as well, because of\u00a0the Pensieve and its many memories we dive into. This is the only way to do flashbacks... especially given the unbiased perspective to these unfolding events, like getting an introduction into Voldemort's family line from someone employed by the Department of Magical Law Enforcement,\u00a0and then slowly piecing together bits of information through the many reveals.But before all that can happen, the book starts off where Harry feels most at peace: The Burrow. I love me some good ol' family dynamics with the Weasleys (and being a united front against\u00a0Phlegm\u00a0Fleur).\u201cWell, all I can say is that it was a lucky day for the Weasleys when Ron decided to sit in your compartment on the Hogwarts Express, Harry.\u201dHarry is slowly starting to view Ginny as a safe haven; she represents all good and safety in the world for Harry, which he desperately seeks with the upheaval that is his own life. I laughed when my mind associated Harry's choice of Ginny Weasley with that scene from Parks and Rec with the Saperstein twins:Harry Potter and The Half-Blood Prince\n  \n\u00a0centers on the more obsessed-like state of Harry with Malfoy, Hermione sulking away from Won-Won, Roonil Wazlib making a mighty comeback, the frustration when no one believes Harry's valid suspicions, and so much more which I feature\u00a0below in my favorite points:\u2022 The sly insert when Slughorn dismisses Ron's name with:\u00a0\u201c...after what happened to your poor friend Rupert.\u201d Clearly, filming for the Harry Potter series was well underway.\u2022 This particular book in the series feels like the inspiration behind Baz and Simon in Fangirl (and Carry On) what with the slow-moving plot till the characters arrive onto school grounds, and the aforementioned nemesis-watching from afar and following their every move.\u201cLevi sat back, hugging the pillow again. \u201cThey are kind of gay, aren\u2019t they? What with all the watching each other sleep\u00a0\u2026 and the ignoring Penelope.\u201dI'm personally not into the whole Draco/Harry ship, given Draco literally smashed Harry's face in just because (this ruthlessness is what's so vivid in my mind, so much so that the hurt of that scene traveled through back four years when I first read it and I felt the exact same shock) and also the simple fact that Draco Malfoy is a terribly cruel character. Those types need to stray far, far from humans until they acquire some anger management tools. He's basically a reincarnation of Snape (the only reason they get along) what with all the sulking and pettiness (Snape with Lily, and Draco with his need to acquire power). Just because you've marked a certain person/goal as \"MINE\" in your head doesn't make it so it's yours. So the author trying to make me feel sorry for either of them won't work in my favor. Like, \"Woe is me. All I want is the approval of the Dark Lord.\"It's also the reason why I'm not rushing to reread the following book given the frustrations whenever an author dismisses the actions of an evil character, like Snape, for \"Oh, Love...\" You've painted your picture for the whole series, making us not only hate but despise Severus Snape, so you can't just drop this pent-up anger with one scene in the seventh book. Snape \"loving\" (more like, marking his territory) a certain someone who chooses not to settle for him doesn't justify his following actions, no matter what storyline tries to redeem him.\u2022 The one thing that really settled with me was when Harry and Dumbledore were discussing\u00a0destiny and \"the\u00a0prophecy\" and how it's neither here nor there: Voldemort sculpted his own enemy, by choosing to believe that prophecy he molded you into his enemy. I listened to a lecture on the topic that voiced a similar idea that in order for there to be good in the world there needs to be evil to defeat.\u201cImagine, please, just for a moment, that you had never heard that prophecy! How would you feel about Voldemort now? Think!\u2019Harry watched Dumbledore striding up and down in front of him, and thought. He thought of his mother, his father and Sirius. He thought of Cedric Diggory. He thought of all the terrible deeds he knew Lord Voldemort had done. A flame seemed to leap inside his chest, searing his throat.\u2018I\u2019d want him finished,\u2019 said Harry quietly. \u2018And I\u2019d want to do it.\u2019\u2018Of course you would!\u2019 cried Dumbledore. \u2018You see, the prophecy does not mean you have to do anything! But the prophecy caused Lord Voldemort to mark you as his equal \u2026 in other words, you are free to choose your way, quite free to turn your back on the prophecy! But Voldemort continues to set store by the prophecy. He will continue to hunt you \u2026 which makes it certain, really, that -\u2018\u2018That one of us is going to end up killing the other,\u2019 said Harry. \u2018Yes.\u2019\u201d\u2022 The main plot-propelling point is circling around the Pensieve, which at the time of reading I found so fascinating and wondered what memories I would store away. However brilliant the first memory from Bob Ogden, sooner than later these flashbacks start feeling like a contrived set up for a grander plot-device, especially when Dumbledore speaks like he's looking through a crystal ball; Professor Trelawney seems tame in comparison.\u201cWhy?\u2019 said Harry at once, looking up into Dumbledore\u2019s face. \u2018Why did he come back? Did you ever find out?\u2019\u2018I have ideas,\u2019 said Dumbledore, \u2018but no more than that.\u2019\u2018What ideas, sir?\u2019\u2018I shall tell you, Harry, when you have retrieved that memory from Professor Slughorn,\u2019 said Dumbledore. \u2018When you have that last piece of the jigsaw, everything will, I hope, be clear \u2026 to both of us.\u201dThis was so defeating to read the first time, being held on a leash with the information that could be released, but on this reread, knowing what's ahead, I could relax and take in all the suspense and foreshadowing.\u2022 It's unfortunate, though, that the author deems all these important adult figures in Harry's life valuable only long enough to serve him in the grand scheme of things. Children need adults to look up to for longer than a semester period. I noticed that even when I was having a good time reading, half-way through a thought would creep in to remind me that half of the characters wouldn\u2019t survive this series\u2026 and then it felt somehow wrong to laugh at something they said.\u2022Which leads me to discuss the one thing that I dreaded and put-off... I'd forgotten that rereading Harry Potter and The Half-Blood Prince meant reliving this emotional trauma of a chapter all-over again. I honestly can't believe I got fooled twice into believing that Snape would come to heal Dumbledore. I was utterly and positively assured that when Severus Snape came running down towards Dumbledore it was to cure him of his wounds. My brain somehow managed to repress the memory of that scene and fooled me into believing the same damn thing I thought the very first time... Evidently, the events of this series have all mixed into one for me so that certain scenes from the last book I expect to show up in here. Though nothing prepared me for this line that broke everything:\n\u2018I am not worried, Harry,\u2019 said Dumbledore, his voice a little stronger despite the freezing water. \u2018I am with you.\u2019\nIf nothing else, I'll certainly miss his sage sayings:\n\n\n      \u2018Dumbledore says people find it far easier to forgive others for being wrong than being right,\u2019 said Hermione.\n    \n\n\nI commend the cover illustrator, Jonny Duddle, for taking one of the most painful moments in the book and creating such lively artwork out of it:The illustration on the back cover, in particular, had me staring back and forth to take it all in: the tired eye-bags, the sullen face, the grip on his left arm.

As this was the penultimate book, I think many of us knew going into it that Dumbledore would die before the end.As this book is mainly about Harry spending time with Dumbledore, it was bittersweet. Like an ailing relative who knows they don't have much time left, trying to make the most of their remaining days. I would like to think that Albus saw Harry as a sort of adopted grandson.Albus knew his time was coming and set his affairs in order. He even made plans to die on his own terms, with all of the courage one must have when gallantly facing their mortality.Even though he was a fictional character, his death was still a blow.
