Vin is still my hero! \u2764\ufe0fHoly son of a biscuit eater!!! THIS BOOK! I loved it, loved it, loved it! Sanderson tackled most of my feels in this book and YES I cried here and there but most of it was happy crying. My dog even looked at me like I was crazy when I was laughing and crying and yelling YES at certain parts. Vin landed softly on the damp cobblestones, watching as the mists began to form around her. They puffed into existence as darkness fell, growing like tangles of translucent vines, twisting and wrapping around one another.The great city of Luthadel was still. Even now, a year after the Lord Ruler's death and the rise of Elend's new free government, the common people stayed in their homes at night. They feared the mists, a tradition that went far deeper than the Lord Ruler's laws. Vin slipped forward quietly, senses alert. Inside herself, as always, she burned tin and pewter. Tin enhanced her senses, making it easier for her to see in the night. Pewter made her body stronger, made her lighter on her feet. These, along with copper--which had the power to hide her use of Allomancy from others who were burning bronze--were metals she left on almost all the time. Some called her paranoid. She thought herself prepared. Either way, the habit had saved her life on numerous occasions.I love Vin and she grew so much in this book. She had a very bad life growing up and Kelsier (sob) saved her from all of that and showed her how to be what she is: A Mistborn. (An Allomancer who can burn all of the Allomantic medals) and she became the most powerful Mistborn around. Elend is the King but he wasn't doing such a great job. He needed to be whipped into shape. I think Tindwyl (a Keeper from Terris) did a wonderful job and getting Elend where he needed to be. I feel Elend figured the rest out on his own and I began to love his character later on in the book. Tindwyl nodded. \"Sazed also mentioned your humility. It could be an asset-assuming you don't let it get in the way. Now, I believe that your Mistborn has returned.\"Elend turned toward the side window. The shutter swung open, allowing mist to begin streaming into the room and revealing a crouching, cloaked form. \"How did you know I was here?\" Vin asked quietly. Tindwyl smiled--the first such expression Elend had seen on her face. \"Sazed mentioned you as well, child. You and I should speak soon in private, I think.\"Vin slipped into the room, drawing mist in behind her, then closed the shutter. She didn't bother to hide her hostility or mistrust as she put herself between Elend adn Tindwyl. \"Why are you here?\" Vin demanded. Tindwyl smiled again. \"It took your king there several minutes to get to that question, and here you ask it after a few bare moments. You are an interesting couple, I think.\" Vin's eyes narrowed. \"Regardless, I should withdraw,\" Tindwyl said. \"We shall speak again, I assume, Your Majesty?\"\"Yes, of course.\" Elend said. \"Um. . . is there anything I should begin practicing?\"\"Yes,\" Tindwyl said. \"Stop saying um.\"\"Right.\"Tindwyl had a lot of work to get the king where he needed to be but she did well. So many of the characters I loved. VinElendSazedOreSeurHamDocksonClubsSpookBreezeTindwylAllrianneSome of them didn't make it in the battles and that is sad but that is the way of the world. I also really liked Zane but . . . .*I loved the characters, I loved the book, I loved everything about it but a few things.*NOW ON TO THE SPOILER PORTION OF THIS BOOK. DO NOT READ BELOW THIS LINE IF YOU HAVEN'T READ THE BOOK!Okay lets get down to the nitty gritty. I'm going to be all over the place with this so just bear with me. Zane is the other mistborn that would visit with Vin and sometimes fight with her. We find out that he is Elends half-brother. I really liked him and wanted him to be good but he had some major issues cause by their father that is/was a complete jerk. I really hated to see him die but it had to happen. I certainly didn't see it coming. Elend's father along with two other army's are parked outside the city, they all want to take over Luthadell so they can all have the atium. It's a big time metal that lets mistborns see into others futures and when they are burning it they normally can't be killed. Until Vin proved that wrong! When Vin killed Straff (Elend and Zane's father) I was freaking out of my mind with joy! I didn't like what happened to the horse but still. It was freaking awesome that she finally took his sorry arse out! Another camp had king Cett in it and he was just stupid, that's all I got. But his daughter, Allrianne was pretty cool. I liked her. The last camp had an old friend of Elend as the leader and he had these monster things called Koloss, they were these blue giant things and they were not stable at all. They killed each other as much as they killed other people. He controlled them through money and luck, in the beginning anyway. Most of the beginning of the book is learning about Vin and Elend, trying to get them where they need to be, learning things from Sazed and Tindwyl, figuring out how to defeat the armies and not knowing where the atium was in the city. They never did find it so it seemed like they were all going to get killed for nothing. Sazed really surprised me. He was a Keeper but had some issues back home, but he still did his work. But he freaking used all kinds of powers and turned into Hulk Sazed when it was time to fight the Koloss! He was freaking amaze balls! He had sent Vin, Elend and Spook away on a wild goose chase for the well of ascension and Vin had to rush back (pun intended) to help everyone. The town was going to die without her. She was so mad but she understood what Sazed was trying to do. She got there in the nick of time! The koloss loomed over Sazed, who still lay half sprawled in the bloody slush, and raised its sword. Over the creature's shoulder, Sazed could see the red sun hanging just above the top of the wall. He focused on that, rather than on the falling sword. He could see the rays of sunlight, like . . . shards of glass in the sky. The sunlight seemed to sparkle, twinkling, coming for him. As if the sun itself were welcoming him. Reaching down to accept his spirit. And so, I die . . . A twinkling droplet of light sparkled in the beam of sunlight, then hit the koloss directly in the back of the skull. The creature grunted, stiffening, dropping it's sword. It collapsed to the side, and Sazed lay, stupefied, on the ground for a moment. Then he looked up at the top of the wall. A small figure stood silhouetted by the sun. Black before the red light, a cloak flapped gently on her back. Sazed blinked. The bit of sparkling light he'd seen. . . it had been a coin. The koloss before him was dead. Vin had returnedJust typing that scene out gave me chills once again and made me tear up in joy! Vin is bad to the damn bone, there is no doubt about that. At one point after killing hundreds of the monsters, Vin figured out how to control them so that was even more awesome! I was really sad for Sazed for losing Tindwyl, they had finally admitted their love for each other in a sense and it was so sad to see him go through his grief. I also hated that Clubs and Dockson had to die but this is what happens. I dread to see how else will die in the next book =(Oh, I forgot to mention how much I loved OreSeur (Vin's Kandra). Kelsier had given him to her when he died and the kandra have contracts to do what you say. They are slaves basically. They take on forms of humans or animals by eating their bones after they are already dead. They don't kill people themselves. Vin at one point turned OreSeur into a wolfhound. So awesome, but he wasn't happy about being a dog. But he finally got used to it. But then I find out that OreSeur was killed and replaced with Zane's kandra (TenSoon) to spy on Vin. I was crushed, but it turned out that TenSoon wasn't so bad. There is a lot more to it but you can read about it. Vin finds the well of ascension in the town. It calls to her. She's not supposed to be there. Sazed tries to stop her but doesn't quite make it. She goes into the well to save Elend's life (her husband, yeah they got married in a quick little ceremony with Sazed while was stitching her up) and she let loose something that wasn't supposed to be let loose on the world. But she saved Elend and turned him into a freaking Mistborn. I mean wow. I can only imagine what's going to happen in the next book! I'm going to shut up now as I have left a long rambling review of this book. It just thrilled me that much! Thank you Brandon Sanderson for these characters I love so much! MY BLOG: Melissa Martin's Reading List"}, {"Review": "I have only one word for this and it is: #nope. This was the most insufferably tedious book of my life. And duuuude, I loved The Final Empire! It was exciting and had a con artist thing going on and magical wizard people with an epic magic system. WHAT HAPPENED TO THE SEQUEL. I went from adoring Sanderson to probably never trying a book by him again.Excuse me. I kind of need to walk into a brick wall and scream a little because I am so 100000% done with this this beast.A BRIEF LIST OF WHY I AM AN ANGRY GRAPE:\u2022 It was frikkin' boring. And I mean, absolutely desperately boring, to the point where like TWO SCENES ever happened: Elend having long political discussions + Vin punching people. Over and over and over again.\u2022 Nothing happened in the first 500 pages except TALKING. #bored\u2022 Vin turned into a weeping willow. Like the actual tree. Except at least a tree doesn't spend so much time whining. Where is the epic wizard we had in book 1???? She spent all her time fussing over Elend, disbelieving that he loved her, wishing he could take care of himself...and then when he did grow a backbone SHE GOT OFFENDED THAT HE DIDN'T NEED HER ANYMORE.\u2022 Stahp, please, woman. Please. I couldn't stand Vin and this breaks my heart because I used to adore her??\u2022 Elend was a small spot of interest. He had A+ character development, but he also was a soft little squidgy pudding with a heart of gold and, well, I am not. It was tedious (for me) just reading about him continually being like \"OMG I WANT WHAT'S BEST FOR THE POLITICS OMG WHY ARE THEY REJECTING ME\". \u2022 Pages and pages and pages of tedious meetings. Like let's discuss politics. Again, and again. Let's come to no conclusions. Let's all contradict each other for lols. Let's never agree because, again, looooool.\u2022The small bright spot was Zane, a new mistborn character. Who was \"crazy\" and like this ANNOYED ME SO MUCH because his only personality trait was that he's \"crazy\". That's insulting. I don't know if he had schizophrenia (he heard \"God\" telling him to kill people?) but please stop lumping people with mental illness into this \"we have no personality, just craziness\" trope because it's harmful. (view spoiler)[ And then Zane died anyway and so did my interest. (hide spoiler)]\u2022 Did I mention the word TEDIOUS yet? Because NOTHING was fREAKING HAPPENING.\u2022 I maybe skimmed. Fight me.\u2022 Why didn't the orcs eat everyone? Oh excuse me, the koloss. But still. That would've made everything so much more fun.\u2022 Also it has the SAME plot as Steelheart. Okay, granted, this came first, but it bothers me when an author can have two seperate series and they have the same plot?? Book 1: take down an evil overlord. Book 2: have a panic attack because the world can't function economically without evil overlord. Book 3: be a hot mess. (Okay idek if the next Mistborn books will be a hot mess because I will not be eating them.)\u2022 ALSO IT WAS SO SEXIST. Elend refuses to spar with Vin so he \"doesn't lose to a girl\" and therefore lose the last of his dignity. There was only ONE FEMALE (Vin) for the first half of the book, and then the second female was just a servant type anyway. Males everywhere. Males blotting out the sun. God rest their souls (please, like, rest 'em). Vin being given grief for not \"dressing like a female\" because you can't be feminine in pants, apparently. LiKE THE LIST GOES ON AND I'M SICK OF IT.\u2022 Why did the fight scenes have to be 9 chapters long?? Because you know what makes a fight scene fun and exciting? WHEN IT MOVES FAST AND IS SHORT AND QUICK. If I have to read another detailed account about how another coin flips in the air, I'm going to flip a table.\u2022 I am asleep. Ugh.I'M DONE. SO VERY DONE. 5000% DONE. I have no malice towards anyone who loves this series. GOOD ON YOU. I wish I had to, because I generally adore fantasy. But this, for me, was slow and tediously detailed, the characters were clingy and petulant (I've read books about teenagers who are more mature than these adults), and 700+ pages of people JUST TALKING is enough to make me fling my brain into the sun and go take up herding sheep in iceland instead of reading. "}, {"Review": "4.5/5 starsA slow paced book containing an utterly powerful climax sequence; a spectacular middle book for the Mistborn trilogy.When I first read The Well of Ascension, my experience was that I thoroughly loved it. It\u2019s not until later that I discovered that apparently, a lot of people found the book disappointing. Because of this, I was scared that my reread experience would be ruined. Apparently, there\u2019s nothing to worry about. Yes, it\u2019s slightly an inferior book in comparison to The Final Empire but my overall experience of this reread is that I found the book almost as good as the first time I read through it. Picture: The Well of Ascension by breath-artThe Well of Ascension storyline took place a year after the end of the first book. The majority of the plotline revolved around Luthadel being sieged from many sides and now, Vin, Elend, and everyone must do everything in their power to stop the upcoming threat; also dealing with Luthadel\u2019s internal political turmoil. The Well of Ascension at its core is a slow-paced book that\u2019s very heavy on politics and making sure the characters\u2019 motivation end up in the right set of mind before the final installment of the trilogy. This resulted in a lot of talking, contemplation, with no actions at all. However, despite all these, I was never bored; I lost track of time like Elend did.\n\n\u201cElend: I kind of lost track of time\u2026Breeze: For two hours?Elend: There were books involved.\u201d \n\nI never mind slow-paced book as long that there are excellent characterizations in it, and in my opinion this book delivers on that front greatly; this were especially true for Vin, Elend, Sazed, and OroSeur. I know a lot of readers were bored because they found the first \u00be of the book too slow or uneven in pacing, which in a way is kind of true because it contained almost zero action sequences. However, the mystery, the character developments, the magic system, and the world were more than enough to give me joy. I didn\u2019t think the 500 pages as useless or boring, it was an engaging and very well-written exploration on leadership, identity, love, and faith. \n\n\u201cA man can only lead when others accept him as their leader, and he has only as much authority as his subjects give to him. All of the brilliant ideas in the world cannot save your kingdom if no one will listen to them.\u201d\n\nI won\u2019t lie that there was some scene that was unnecessary and yes, some part did go for a bit longer than it should but in my opinion, the slow and long build-up truly made the last 150 pages explode in quality.\n\n\u201cIt's easy to believe in something when you win all the time...The losses are what define a man's faith.\u201d\n\nThere was also a new metal to burn for the Mistborn her, duralumin. This single metal expanded the magic system and action sequences of the trilogy exponentially. Back when I first read the first book, I thought the magic system introduced in the first book was it for the trilogy. I couldn\u2019t be more wrong because Sanderson ceaselessly expanded the complexity of the magic system with each installment; this includes the next book and Mistborn Era 2. The existence of duralumin made all the action sequences\u2014especially the last 150 pages\u2014in the book oozing with greatness; it was similar to Attack on Titan battle scene, which means it was incredible.Picture: Interior artworks for the The Well of Ascension Leatherbound edition by Charles Tan (left) and Miranda Meeks (right)In terms of world-building, Sanderson also did a great job in utilizing the epigraph once again to explore the lore and the mystery aspect of the book. Specifically on The Deepness and the Well of Ascension itself. Plus, the nature and secret of the Kandra and Koloss revealed here were utterly beneficial in catching my interest in the book and never let go.Although the book contained some elements of the infamous second book syndrome, it was one of the rare cases where I still end up enjoying it, very thoroughly. The first-time reader of the book may not know it yet but The Well of Ascension served its purpose as a middle book installment; whether the reader like the book or not that\u2019s another story. In my opinion, Sanderson has set the stage for the transcending conclusion in The Hero of Ages magnificently with this installment and once again, even upon reread, I\u2019m still amazed by how much this book holds up for me.You can find this and the rest of my reviews at Novel Notions"}, {"Review": "Reviewed by: Rabid Reads3.5 starsAnytime I'm reading fantasy for review, I take copious notes. In fact, most of the time, my review is pretty much written by the time I finish the book, I just need to make slight alterations to account for any last minute goings on.And I like that, b/c your average fantasy is 2 - 3x longer than any other book. Trying to go back after the fact and recall all the key details would be a nightmare.BUT.Brandon Sanderson has consistently thwarted me in this area. And by consistently, I mean every, single time.Why do you hate me, Mr. Sanderson? WHY?!If I were to rate a Sanderson book--any Sanderson book--prior to the last 20%, almost all of them would hover around the 3.0 star range. But unlike most books that benefit from higher ratings b/c OMG, THAT ENDING!, my experience with Sanderson has been very different. Yes, there is definitely an element of OMG and FEELS overwhelming your brain stem, making you instantly forget whatever had you feeling so MEH for the majority of the book, but that's only one small aspect of the turnaround. I'll get to the greater part in a minute.I've called Sanderson a master of misdirection several times, but I'm finding it to be especially true in this first MISTBORN trilogy.You know what happened last time . . . This time . . . it wasn't quite as drastic, but it had a greater impact on my overall reaction to the book.B/c initially, I didn't much like this one.We know from THE FINAL EMPIRE that the Well of Ascension is where the shit went down. The Lord Ruler traveled to the mountains of Terris as prophecy dictated to seize its power and defeat the Deepness . . . A power that wasn't meant to be contained but released, and in selfishly keeping that power to serve his own purposes, the Lord Ruler became the new Evil.With his death the Deepness is returning. His ominous last words proved truthful, and whatever had been holding it back is now absent. Strange shapes take insubstantial form and stalk the Mist by night, and by day . . . no longer banished by light, the Mist attacks and kills defenseless villagers.And Vin is drawn by a distant thrumming, a constant drum beat in the distance that only she can hear . . . calling her to the Well.You'd think that a journey across a land filled with various and dangerous threats would make for an excellent second installment, and it would have . . . if the book had been about a journey across a land filled with various and dangerous threats.But it wasn't. It was about about a city besieged by not one, not two, but THREE armies, one full of the remnants of one of the Lord Ruler's monstrous creations.It was about a naive manboy who needed to lose the boy and become a king. It was about a insecure girl who loves Manboy, but thinks he deserves far better than her. It was about grasping factions in a fledgling government and political scheming and backstabbing, and while that may sound marvelous in theory . . . After roughly 600 pages, it's dreadfully dull.Especially after an action-packed first installment, which brings up another complaint . . . This is the second time I've encountered a lackluster sequel in a Sanderson series, so while I'm not 100% that it's a pattern, it is 2:2 which dramatically increases the likelihood . . . It goes like this:Book 1 - first 80% can be slow and consists primarily of misdirection, false trails, etc. leading to the brilliant chaos of the last 20%. World-building and character development are typically enough to keep you engaged.Book 2 - favors political scheming over action, lots of agonizing(ly boring) soul searching, angst-fueled love triangle, and above all else, miscommunication and refusal to confront emotional problems directly.If this is a pattern, Mr. Sanderson, you need to break it. Sooners rather than laters, baby.But despite my annoyance with the lack of progress towards the ultimate goal being somewhat neutralized by last minute revelations (which, by the way, is as frustrating as it is gratifying), those revelations cannot mitigate how completely over I was the Vin/Elend relationship drama. Part of me feels like it would've been more honest to call this book: I'M NOT GOOD ENOUGH, HE'S GOING TO LEAVE ME, WHEN WILL HE LEAVE ME?, HE'S GOING TO LEAVE ME.Long, I know. Probably one of the many reasons they went with something else. But it would have been more accurate than THE WELL OF ASCENSION.And as I said, this is the second time Sanderson has done this to us. I'm baffled. This kind of teen-angsty melodrama has no place in adult high fantasy. NONE.But, also again, a handful of new characters (Zane and Tindwyl) and careful threading of impossible-to-detect-foundations for later plot twists kept it from being a total loss. (view spoiler)[Kind of difficult to stay angry about the lack of journey, when a journey isn't actually necessary. Not to mention that whatever Vin let loose from the Well apparently manipulated the whole prophecy into existence to orchestrate its release . . . Seriously, where does he come up with this stuff? (hide spoiler)] <------If there had been just slightly less drama, those things alone would have made this a strong 4.0 star read for me. BUT. Drama. Recommended with qualifications. Book 3 is up next, so I'll let you know how it goes.8/26/15: BUDDY READ with my peeps in \nSanctum of Fantasy\n.My other reviews for this series:\nMistborn: The Final Empire (Mistborn, #1)\n"}, {"Review": "Please don\u2019t hate me, but I just didn\u2019t love this one as much as the first. As someone else described, I think it suffered from \u201cMiddle Book syndrome\u201d, and really that\u2019s on me. I almost always struggle with the middle installment of a trilogy, even if I 5 STAR Books 1 and 3. There were things I loved, but it felt like the flow didn\u2019t build as well in this one as before. I will say that Sazed\u2019s plot line was the crown jewel of this book! I adore that man and I love his development throughout as well as his struggle coming to grips with what he really believes. Still very excited to read Hero Of Ages and will post a full review after we settle down from our move this weekend! "}, {"Review": "I like a story that surprises me, and this series keeps doing it. The ending of the last book was undoubtedly epic. I don\u2019t know how Brandon Sanderson does it. It felt like the closing chapter for these characters, but, in reality, it was only the beginning of the series. The Lord Ruler\u2019s death could have been the ending, but he was only the surface issue. Indeed, with his death a whole host of problems arose, and none of them are as simple as they appear. This proved that the generic plot of the first book was, in fact, a mere illusion. Nothing is as straightforward as it looks in this world.  The survivors must work together  The Empire is in complete turmoil. Despite the Lord Ruler's tyranny, he did keep the empire together. With him gone there is no anchor; there is no fear: there is only chaos. Vin and Ellen must attempt to keep the city from descending into complete anarchy. This is no easy task because without the ultimate symbol of power, others will come to take advantage. The threat of three invading armies suddenly dawns on them. They have no real defence; they have no solid army. All they have is their wits and a group of charismatic rogues to save the day. And, if that threat wasn\u2019t enough, the shadow of a deeper enemy approaches.\"That's the point, isn't it? We have to live on, no matter how hard it gets. We'll win in the end.\"The plot turns and alliances twist, factions form and breakdown, whilst more questions are raised as to the origins of the Lord Ruler. What power did he have to keep the people in line? Why is this shadow only approaching now with his demise? Surely, if he kept this evil at bay, he may not have been pure evil? Well, that is what some of the characters begin to realise; they begin to see that his reign of terror may have been for a purpose. And, in this, resides my true reverence of this series. Sanderson has disguised his novels; he made the story initially look basic, in which it harboured the same tired old plot with seen several times since  The Lord of the Rings.Then, he slowly reveals what is actually happening, and at the same time shocked me to the core.  The awesome, awesome, characters  Although this book is a little slow, in places, it\u2019s still fantastic. The character development throughout this series is almost explosive. In this novel Vin has become so much more than she initially was. Her training with Kelisar was merely the beginnings in her exploration of her capabilities; her battle with the Lord Ruler changed her; she has become more powerful and confident; she knows how to wield her powers in new and interesting ways: she knows how to kill, and how to do it well. In this, she has become the leader Kelisar\u2019s rogues. She has filled the gap he left behind. And, in addition, what happens to the bookish Ellen, at the end of the novel, changes a lot of things. \"Elend: I kind of lost track of time\u2026Breeze: For two hours?Elend: There were books involved.\"He\u2019s a little more that the book reading leader of the city now, I\u2019ll say no more, but I really didn\u2019t see THAT coming. This is such a great series that never fails to surprise me, as soon as I begin to predict the plot I should know that something else entirely is going to happen. But, I\u2019ll keep trying anyway. \n\u201cThere's always another secret.' -Kelsier\u201d\n The Mistborn Series1.  The Final Empire - A misty four stars2.

The losses are what define a man's faith.\u201d...My soul was slain upon finishing this book, and I'm now writing this review from beyond the grave.You know what I did when I turned the last page of The Well of Ascension? Well, I shrieked like a banshee into my pillow first (because I'm a considerate roommate, thank you very much). I cried. A LOT. And then, I curled up into a ball on my bed and stared at the wall in silence.I'm an incoherent mess and it's been over a month since I finished this masterpiece. How am I supposed to cope with that ending? My mind is still completely reeling. The Well of Ascension takes place a year after the finale of The Final Empire. We follow Vin and Elend as they grapple with the ramifications of the first book. The first installment in the Mistborn series was an epic heist novel, but the sequel was so different. This book is a sweeping political fantasy brimming with tension, action, magic, and secrets. I was enthralled from page one.Brandon Sanderson is a genius at world building. I'm continuously swept away by his stories. The world of Mistborn is rich, expansive, and so so so interesting. Every facet of Scadriel (look up his Cosmere worlds, they're insane), from its history to its religions and myths, are intricately structured and grandiose. I would read an entire textbook on this world. Truly, Sanderson has a gift at giving the reader little tidbits here and there while keeping up the intrigue and mystery.I can't wait to find out more. I have so many thoughts and theories.And the \ncharacters.\n I thought I liked Vin in the first book, but in here? Woah. Vin is a total fucking BADASS. Dear Lord, she's grown so much. Vin's character arc throughout this second installment was so great. Her inner struggles, her insecurities, grief, and fears were relatable, and the way she overcame her struggles in this book made her one of my favorite characters in this story. I truly love Vin.I'm also surprised with Elend's character development. I thought he was a bit of a snobby boyscout in The Final Empire, and I didn't have particularly strong feelings towards Vin and Elend's relationship. But in this book? I loved them together. It also helped that Elend became a strong, capable leader in this book. My son is all grown up. *sniffles* And it's all thanks too a new favorite of mine...Tindwyl. God damn. She's an intellectual badass with the air of a Slytherin and the heart of a Gryffindor. I love this woman. SO MUCH. And my favorite character, Sazed, has a history with her and I just wanna swoon. I love these two. Sazed is my absolute favorite and I adore them both. Can I just have an entire book about them? That would be amazing.All of the side characters continue to endear me. Breeze, Ham, Clubs and Spook. I adore this band of criminals turned revolutionaries. There was even a new character, Zane, that I found to be really compelling. I hope to see more of him in the next book. Even the main antagonist of this story, Lord Venture, was a great villain: deceitful, manipulative, and a frustrating foil to our heroes. Even though the plot was a bit slower-paced than the previous book, I was never bored with this installment. The political scheming and machinations made for some nail-biting tension, leading to a finale that blew my fucking mind. What a glorious, bloody, batshit crazy ending that was. SO MUCH HAPPENED.I'm in awe. And I'm also devastated. And blown away.I have a feeling the next book will ruin my life.I adored this book, if you couldn't already tell. I can't fully convey how much I love this series, and how truly EPIC it is. All I can do is scream from the rooftops and recommend these books to \neverybody.\n I LOVE THEM SO MUCH.Whelp...I need to get to The Hero of Ages. FAST."}, {"Review": "4.5 stars. Oh man, these books are hard to rate. This was a lot like the first one where I was mildly interested in the beginning, then pretty bored for a good chunk of the book... and then flipping through the last 20% like I was SO into the brilliant last bit that I ended the book thinking 5 STARS. GREATEST BOOK EVER. Buuuuut then I remembered that throughout most of the book I was more likeI don't want to say much about the plot that would spoil this book, but I'll still hide these few plot points in case people haven't read the first book: (view spoiler)[Elend is king now and Vin is busy trying to figure out who's the impostor in their midst. She also may or may not be the Hero of Ages (hide spoiler)]. There's a whole army at their gates, a ton of awesome battle scenes, and more is revealed about the Deepness and Vin's power. Ok, I basically summarized nothing... SO MUCH HAPPENS in this book. And there are so many characters. This whole world is just amazingly complex and I love the ideas so much. I don't know if I read too many books lately or why I've stopped having much emotional response to most stories, but this one actually made me tear up still. And then THAT ENDING was all sorts ofBasically the last 10% was so amazing that I need to stop typing this now and go read the third book."}, {"Review": "I feel here as if I ought to apologize to my friends who love these books. The first was okay but I found the pacing a bit slow and had a \"my interest comes and goes\" experience. Sadly if I compare the pacing of the first volume of the series to the pacing in this one (the second volume) the story in volume 1 moved like the wind.I know that some are very involved here and love these, and I can see why. The characters have depth and you get an \"in depth\" view of their lives. Not only their lives but their conversations, their internal struggles, their dietary preferences...the kind of clothes they like, on and on and on.I found myself slowly getting involved in the story but then we'd hit a spot where we had to go through an internal dialogue concerning doubts, paranoia...or possibly psychosis (\"no one will ever stay with you, everyone will leave you\". This should have been followed by a \"bwa-ha-ha\" when it popped into Vin's mind).When I was reading as I said I was mildly interested but when I'd laid the book aside I didn't think about it. I was hard pressed to get back to it there were just things I'd rather read. I finely got \"re-interested\" about the end of part three as the story of the throne moved on and plots started to come to light only to get thrown back into (view spoiler)[ \"Oh why did he have to see me burst that guy's head...boo hoo hoo. Oh! he flinched when I touched him, oh boo hoo hoo...[no one will ever stay with you Vin, everyone will leave you Vin!]..see Mistborn: The Final Empire for a full explanation.] (hide spoiler)]So in the end, two stars for my recognition of the writer's ability and the story telling I can see buried under what seems to me a lot of excess verbiage. If it's your cup of tea enjoy. I doubt I'll finish the trilogy. I mean how many 800+ page tomes do we need? Don't get me wrong, I love a good long epic fantasy, it's just that so often any more, people choose to tell a story in 1000 pages that could be told in 250.My opinion throughout of course.

Sorry Rod! \ud83d\ude2cBoth books have gone in completely different directions and I\u2019ve enjoyed that so much. Usually the 2nd book in a series is not as strong but that\u2019s not the case in The Well of Ascension.I\u2019m so impressed with Brandon Sanderson on this series. He has written a world that is detailed and complicated. It's always on the edge of war, starvation or total collapse from The Deepness. A magical, allomancy system that\u2019s just so complex and unique.From political turmoil to betrayals, it\u2019s all so well written in these books. I never figure out the plot twists and god damn, I love that!In the 2nd book, Luthadel is surrounded by enemies, Elend is a weak but idealistic king and winter is coming.Dun dun dun! *cue serious music*One thing that I\u2019ve enjoyed in both books is how subtle Sanderson writes about morality. I've enjoyed watching Elend go from an idealistic and weak nobleman to something much more.Vin is amazing as always and I loved how she struggled with being a Mistborn in this book. Trying to understand her role in Elend's life and whether she's a good person with how often she has to kill assassins.I can\u2019t wait to see where Sanderson takes the characters of Elend and Vin in the next book!The pacing was a bit slow in some places but I didn\u2019t mind. I looked at it as developing the story, the betrayals and the battle at the end. Wow, the battle at the end with the koloss was just epic.There's just so much going on with the main characters, the Assembly, secondary characters to the whole story of understanding The Deepness.The end left me with a lot of questions to be answered in book #3. I can\u2019t wait to go back to Luthadel and the Dominances.This book is just packed with TENSION?!!Rack up the T E N S I O N ! !I just couldn\u2019t put this down.I fully recommend the first two books of the Mistborn trilogy to anyone - whether or not you're a fantasy genre fan. The books are a joy to read! They\u2019re also thought provoking and deep.Seriously, what are you waiting for? Go pick up this series now and read it!DO. IT. NOW!"}, {"Review": "Whew. That was long.There was quite a time lapse between my reading of this one and the first one, which can be attributed solely to the length of these books. 750+ fucking pages, people. Don't get me wrong, I've read some long books in my decades of dedicated reading, but still...quite the commitment, no?But enough about the completely self-evident length of this book, which - being that this is a Brandon Sanderson book - is a surprise to no one. I adored book one in this series. ADORED it. Like, we are talking first rate adoration here, my friends. The slap this thing on my tops reads of all time shelf and spend the ensuing year trying to force my dad to read it level of adoration.

And, while I'm not saying this book didn't...deliver...I will say that it didn't hold me quite as spellbound as book one. This one had a lot of politics and bureaucracy which really bogged the beginning and middle of the story down. There was a lot less action and a lot more contemplation - in the form of \"does he love me?\" teenage angst variety, which I didn't love - than the first book, which also made the story trudge along in certain areas. Other than that though, the middle/ending really picked up and I enjoyed it immensely. Book three promises to be EPIC.I just hope I don't drag my feet getting to it."}, {"Review": "The Well of Ascension was a beautiful follow-up to The Final Empire. There's so much going on now that it's difficult to speak on a lot of the specifics, so my review will focus on more general overview of what I enjoyed and what I didn't.\nPlot:\nThe plot was by far the strongest point of the novel. I was just so engrossed in all of the political conversations happening here. I like my high fantasy heavy on the political intrigue with dashes of cunning & betrayal.Plus the last little bit of this story just blew my fucking mind. Sanderson has no mercy when it comes to plot twists. He'll drag you through the ashes of your favorite characters. He'll throw you out of the airplane and shout \"Plot twist! I cut holes in your parachute, bitch!\"It was crazy! But I enjoyed every minute of this plot as it unfolded. \nCharacter Development:\nI feel as though Vin is the only character that really grew at all in this novel. There is an argument to be made for both Sazed and Elend, as they do make some strides forward, but most of the development primarily revolved around Vin. For me, I wanted a little more in this area. I feel like everyone else was static and that didn't really do much for my reading experience.I'm very glad though for all that Vin underwent in this novel because I really wasn't that fond of her in The Final Empire, and so this really helped me sympathize with and understand her as an individual.\nPace:\nThe pace was just a little bit slow in some places for me. As you may or may not know, I'm not normally very bothered by a slow pace. Like we have to be almost moving backwards before I notice anything is amiss. However, there were just a few parts here that dragged a bit longer than I found necessary. Overall though, I didn't much mind the pace. It's methodical, it's well done, and most of the information presented here is necessary. I'm very excited to start the final book in this trilogy. The last section of this novel has me very anxious to find out how this will all end!Buddy read this with sweet Aria, Tweebsiepoo, & my bby Pragya.*UPDATE: Spoilers in my comments section for The Final Empire!"}, {"Review": "\u201cIt's easy to believe in something when you win all the time...The losses are what define a man's faith.\u201d  \u2015 Brandon Sanderson, The Well of AscensionSanderson does it again. This book is absolutely amazing !!All in all, \"The Well of Ascension\" is an exciting sequel to \"The Final Empire\", full of what made the first book so compelling: a great cast of characters, amazing development, an eerily magical world and a thrilling storyline. I will definitely be reading the final book of the trilogy, \"The Hero of Ages\" as soon as possible."}, {"Review": "The Well of Ascension is the 2nd installment of the famous Mistborn series and, as expected, it suffers from the middle book syndrome. I enjoyed reading the new adventures of Vin and the crew but not as much as in The Final Empire. The majority of the plot revolves around the siege of Luthadel by enemies and the planning to protect the city. While some aspects were interesting I believe the talking went on and on for too long. Secondly, the Vin\u2019s teenage angst and doubts about herself and her relationship with Elend drove me mad after pages and pages of interior debates. I missed Kelsier, I thought that his character was what made the first book shine but I loved Sazed and OreSeur in this one. I also enjoyed the plot twist at the end and I can\u2019t wait to read the final book in the trilogy. "}, {"Review": "This is That Book.You know the one.The one you've daydreamed about.The one you hope, deep in your little reader heart, you'll finally find.The one with the plot that is both wide-ranging and intensely personal; with the characters who are all nuanced and flawed; with the complicated political intrigues to keep you guessing; with the shocking twists that are, true to form, both surprising and inevitable.You've slogged through the morass of uninspiring Twilight clones. You've suffered through dystopians trying to be the next Hunger Games. You've struggled to stay awake through overly lengthy fantasy novels written by people who have no idea what made Tolkein so successful, but think they can imitate him anyway.And here - here is a book that deserves every one of its nearly 600 pages. Here is a book with no superfluous sub-plots. Here is a book with no cardboard characters. Here is a series where people grow, change, and generally act like human beings. Here is the perfect mixing of philosophy, action, creativity, and heart.Ladies and gentlemen, I don't think I'll ever be able to fully express how in awe I am of this book.From this point on, this review will contain spoilers for the first of the series, Mistborn: The Final Empire.The story starts grimly. Yes, the Lord Ruler is dead, but that doesn't mean everything is fixed: his empire was a large one, and our heroes are only able to affect small parts of it at a time. Add to that the fact that they've lost their brilliant, charismatic leader and good friend, and it seems the situation is dire. Yet... they've learned something from Kelsier: they laugh in the face of danger. Take, for example, this exchange:Elend looked over at him. \"The Assembly is a mess, a half-dozen warlords with superior armies are breathing down my neck, barely a month passes without someone sending assassins to kill me, and the woman I love is slowly driving me insane.\"Vin snorted at this last part.\"Oh, is that all?\" Ham said. \"See? It's not so bad after all. I mean, we could be facing and immortal god and his all-powerful priests instead.\"They are still the witty, intelligent, compelling heroes we've always rooted for.Or are they?One of the several reasons I think this book is actually better than The Final Empire is that while that one focused primarily on Vin's character development and personal problems, this one expands upon the psyches of the entire cast. Part of the way it does this is through shifting the focus of the third-person limited point of view, so at some point the reader gets to see the thoughts of almost every character. (This is used really brilliantly; more about it later.) The other part is by showing Vin's understanding of others growing; as she develops more sensitivity, she has more insight into their characters. We see the soft heart beneath Clubs' tough exterior, the insecure young man that Spook has become despite his bravado, Ham's pain at being separated from his family, Breeze's devotion to the crew underneath his mercenary attitude.Most of all, we see the troubles of Vin, Elend, and Sazed.Vin has always been a complex girl. The abuse she suffered from her brother, Reen, made it so difficult for her to learn to trust, and even learning that Reen protected her with his last breath hasn't done much for her wary attitude. She still has the potent, niggling fear of abandonment in all of her relationships and so her emotional state is very, very fragile. One of the things I love about her is that she isn't a confident heroine leaking ambition and drive from her very pores. Indeed, her insecurities and doubts are some of what make her so easy to identify with. For a male author, Sanderson does an incredible job portraying what it's like to be a young woman - better, I think, than many female authors do. There is that tenuous balance between wanting to seem self-assured and wanting to be reassured which is highlighted beautifully in Vin's struggles in this book. Her doubts about her relationship with Elend could have seemed superficial, another New Moon-esque created crisis designed to show how much they luuuuuurve each other. Instead, they sprang from very reasonable places, and best of all... they weren't isolated. Like all the characters in this book, Vin interacts with her world, and so her insecurities come not just from the fact that she doesn't know her place in it but also from the fact that others think they do. Zane thinks she's a tool and an unwitting captive. The skaa think she's something close to a goddess, their holy protector. Ironically, Elend is one of the few people who doesn't seem to have any ideas about what Vin should be or is; he accepts her for herself, and that leaves a void in the pressure around her that she shies away from. She doesn't know what he wants from her, and so she projects what she thinks he wants.He loves me, but he's still a man, Vin thought. How many times have I hurt his pride by being Mistborn while he is simply a normal person? A lesser man would never have fallen in love with me.But, doesn't he deserve a woman that he feels he can protect? A woman who's more like... a woman?Vin pulled down in her chair again, seeking warmth within its plushness. However, it was Elend's study chair, where he read. Didn't he also deserve a woman who shared his interests, one who didn't find reading a chore? A woman with whom he could talk about his brilliant political theories?Haven't we all done this? Especially those of us who are writers as well as readers - you narrate in your head, and that includes imagining what other people are thinking about you. It feeds back into any lingering self-consciousness you may be feeling, and in Vin's case it makes her doubt herself.Elend is dealing with the same sort of problems and also with completely different ones. The Elend we knew in the last book was a young, bookish idealist, which was what made him so endearing. The first time he met Vin he complained about her stealing his reading light, for goodness sakes! He was completely adorkable. Readers like me, who have a thing for the nerdy boys, no doubt wanted to believe that his idealism and intelligence would serve him well in creating a utopia after the fall of the Lord Ruler, but that's not the case at all. The same things that were strengths in the first book, which set Elend apart from the rest of the corrupt nobility, are weaknesses here. He lacks social skills, self-confidence, assertiveness. He is not conniving or commanding. He believes so deeply in the innate goodness of people that it makes him blind to deceit and scheming. And while he is a very good legislator, he isn't really a leader.Yet.Elend's evolution from the young man who doesn't really know what to do with his role in life to responsible adult willing to make the hard choices and a few necessary sacrifices is one of the best parts of this book. This is where we really get into his character. When Elend is under pressure, he really shines: with a little help, he transforms into the king he needs to be just in time to have his kingdom pulled out from underneath him by various political forces. As a direct result, he becomes in a way just as insecure as Vin, and he too projects what he thinks she feels about him. These two are so similar at their cores that watching them dance carefully around each other is both beautiful and painful. Their relationship is not the most passionate thing ever penned, but it is sweet and strong, and they're a couple to root for. This is partly because Sanderson doesn't skimp on telling the readers what they admire and love about each other (are you taking notes, YAPNR authors?) and partly because of the irony, that two such intelligent people should be so clueless about themselves. That, too, is another part of being young, I think.Also, they're sensible about their feelings for one another. One line that made me want to cheer: And a kiss is supposed to make it all right? she thought sullenly, sitting back on a stack of books.Oh Vin, you are so fabulous. How many books have I read where a simple kiss can take the heroine's breath away and make her forget her troubles and all sorts of bullshit like that? Thank you, Brandon Sanderson, for writing about a couple who love each other but don't think what they have is the Be-All and End-All. (view spoiler)[Thank you also for the wedding scene, which was just short of being ridiculous but really seemed to suit Vin. Even if poor Elend was a little nonplussed. (hide spoiler)]And that brings me to the last of what I would consider the main characters: Sazed.Oh, Sazed. Poor, poor Sazed. You know, I honestly think he got put through the grinder worse than anyone else in this book. Like Elend, he is an idealist, though his idealism is centered more around the idea that people thirst for knowledge and less around political situations. And that idealism is brutally shattered as the book goes on. It starts out bad enough, as we join Sazed traveling skaa communities, trying to teach them about lost religions but confronted at every turn by scenes like this:\"When is the Lord Ruler coming back?\" asked a woman.\"I do not believe that he will,\" Sazed said.\"Why did he abandon us?\"\"It is a time of change,\" Sazed said. \"Perhaps it is also time to learn of other truths, other ways.\"The group of people shuffled quietly. Sazed sighed quietly; these people associated faith with the Steel Ministry and its obligators. Religion wasn't something that skaa worried about - save, perhaps, to avoid it when possible.The Keepers spent a thousand years gathering and memorizing the dying religions of the world, Sazed thought. Who would have thought that now - with the Lord Ruler gone - people wouldn't care enough to want what they'd lost?It is through Sazed's eyes that we see how the rest of the former Final Empire is faring, and it's not going so well. Because he is older and wiser than Vin and Elend, he perceives more, and there is a sense of desperation to his narrative that only grows over the course of the book. The final battle absolutely destroys him, but it is the epilogue that stands out most to me, because I cannot imagine seeing that scene - when belief completely collapses and horror and despair set in - through anyone's eyes but the man who wants to be a priest of all religions. It shakes the very foundations of the world, but it shakes the reader because of its effect on Sazed. I'm almost scared to see what happens to him as a result of that revelation.Remember the quotes from the logbook that headed every chapter of The Final Empire? There are quotes here, too, and they are definitely a highlight of the book. The journey of the Hero of Ages to the Well of Ascension is shrouded in mystery, and they cast a little more light on who he was and what happened in those last days. They also mirror some of the events of the climax in a way that heightens the tension to almost unbelievable levels. The resonance between the events of a thousand years previously and the events of the book is a powerful tool in the hands of a skilled writer, and Sanderson is definitely that. (view spoiler)[There is an incredible moment when I realized that the Lord Ruler was actually far more well-intentioned than he seemed, and I was almost sorry that he died because his character has more depth in retrospect than I had ever imagined. I love that Sanderson managed to humanize him not once but twice - the first time through Alendi's logbook, which seemed like it was his until the very end, and the second time in the moment that it becomes clear that he made his most important choice for the greater good. Sure, it didn't turn out so well, but he was a flawed human being after all, and by the end of this book he's almost cast in a better light than Vin. His flaws might have resulted in a thousand years of oppression for the skaa, but her flaws led her to release a force of evil on the world. (hide spoiler)]The shifting narration really served the scope of the story well. I particularly liked the sections from Breeze's point of view. Since he's a Soother, he has a good understanding of people and emotions, and the subtle way he manipulates situations to go the way he wants is very interesting. Also compelling is the loyalty he feels to the crew, which I hadn't really expected from him but which makes a lot of sense in hindsight. His viewpoint is the one Sanderson calls on when he needs to show emotions of someone other than the POV character, and it works beautifully. With other authors and other series, this might seem like stepping out of the form of third-person limited narration; here it's perfectly logical.A few other things I liked:Tindwyl, the Terriswoman Keeper who instructed Elend in how to behave like a king. She reminded me of a cross between McGonagall and Lord Wyldon (of Harry Potter and The Protector Of The Small, respectively) and I really enjoyed having her around. While her relationship with Elend was interesting, it was her relationship with Sazed that I was really invested in; it was a great insight into Sazed and into the society of the Keepers. (view spoiler)[I knew from the moment they admitted they loved each other that one of them - or both - was going to die. Damn authors. The good ones have that habit, I think, of making sure you adore the characters RIGHT BEFORE THEY KILL THEM OFF. Hiromu Arakawa, I AM LOOKING AT YOU. (hide spoiler)]Allrianne, who I at first disliked for her attitude and her Valley Girl way of speaking. (No, really. She literally says \"Like, I saw my father's camp.\" FACEPALM.) No spoilers, but there's more to her than what we see on the surface, and I'm interested to see what she gets up to in the next book. Poor Breeze. He has no idea what he's gotten into.The interplay of numerous sub-plots was very graceful, even though some of them have yet to come to fruition. Also, though this book sort of has a cliffhanger, it also has a denouement. I'm not really sure how that worked, but it did.OreSeur, the kandra. Once Vin started being nice to him, their interactions were just... pure gold. No spoilers, but there was a Certain Scene that hit like a punch in the gut as a result.I'm iffy on Zane; he seemed a little forced at times, but in the end his role in the plot was decent. What really interests me was something revealed only near the end, which hopefully will be expanded upon in The Hero Of Ages. (view spoiler)[He mentioned a spike sticking out of his back, like the one placed in Steel Inquisitors. Was that the source of his false insanity? If so, does that explain Marsh's actions? And is it tied to the force from the Well? (hide spoiler)] Suffice it to say that this tidbit sent me off into a bout of theorizing. Whovians, there's about as much material here for pondering as there's been in Series 6 to date. The world of the Mistborn series is pretty damn complicated.To finish up, a couple good quotes:Personally, Vin didn't find the library's location nearly as amusing as its contents. Or, rather, lack thereof. Though the room was lined with shelves, nearly all of them showed signs of having been pillaged by Elend. The rows of books lay pocked by forlorn empty spots, their companions taken away one by one, as if Elend were a predator, slowly whittling down a herd.(Pg. 301)\"Sazed, I've raised some fifteen daughters,\" Tindwyl said, entering the room. \"No teenage girl is stable. Some are just better at hiding it than others.\"(Pg. 426)Sanderson still has one writing habit that annoys me: he puts a comma after every 'but', even when it doesn't seem to suit the sentence. And of course there are places where the same word is used too quickly in succession. I'm not too bothered by that, though, because come on - the book is almost 600 pages long. It's not going to be linguistically flawless. That's fine. As long as it's still an engrossing read (check), one that makes me think a lot (check), full of surprises (check) and identifiable characters (check), I'm happy.This book, and this series: highly recommended. If you haven't read them yet, you owe it to yourself. Don't worry about the size; once you get into them, they go by fast - sometimes faster than you'd want them to.And finally... I don't think live-action techniques can do justice to it just yet, but Mistborn would make an absolutely mind-blowing anime. (Maybe it could go live-action in future. CG is getting pretty good, after all. But I think anime could get away with a lot more voice-over internal narration, which would be crucial.)"}, {"Review": "This book goes something likes this:Elend and the group: Hey, we need to find a way to defeat these two armies, led by tyrants, who've come to conquer the city.Elend and the group:Yes, we should! But first, let us talk about it for 500 pages.Anyway, I've read many reviews that mention this book is slow paced, but to even describe this book merely 'slow-paced' is a big understatement. I think glacial pace describes it much better. You keep thinking it's going to pick up, after all, it's 700 pages, so what if it's slow for the first 200, but no, it had to be slow for nearly 600 pages. Nonetheless, I really liked how well everything ties up at the end. It was planned excellently. "}, {"Review": "Even with its annoying faults, I don\u2019t think I can give this less than a 3.5 star rating. THAT ENDING THOUGH.Overall I\u2019d say this was a good continuation to the series, this one focuses a lot - like A LOT more on politics than actual action like the first book did. However it also focused on character development for both Vin and Elend, the two main characters which Sanderson managed to do fairly well.Sazed is my favourite character in this series. Continuing from the first book he just has a heart of gold and most importantly, he loves telling stories and tales! His relationship with Tindwyl, who I loved as a character was also so well developed and beautiful till the very end.My main grudge with this book is that it really didn\u2019t need to be this long. The first 200 pages or so were just.. talking? And the middle of the book was again talking, but with a little more action and then finally, the ending is FULL of action. Less of that beginning would\u2019ve been better! A lot of it really wasn\u2019t needed!Another grudge I have is that so much of this was Vin moaning and complaining about her feelings about her relationship with Elend and there was just too much of that in my opinion. She kept and kept on switching between \u2018he loves me\u2019.. \u2018he loves me not\u2019... and at times it just got irritating. Stop that Vin, he adores you!I cried twice during this book, Sazed finding Tindwyl\u2019s body (WHY ARE YOU MESSING WITH MY HEART SANDERSON) and when Elend gets attacked at the Well of Ascension. Soooo many feelings!Just read this series if you haven\u2019t already."}, {"Review": "I'm continually impressed with Brandon Sanderson, and I appreciate the subtle (at least to me) morality in his books. As most people who read his books will know, Sanderson comes from a Mormon background, and I think this only enhances his ability and perspective as a writer. I read his first widely published novel Elantris a few years back. The pace, magic, character development, etc., was all good, esp. for a first novel. I eventually picked up Mistborn a few months after its release and this time I was simply blown away - it is a great beginning to a trilogy. It isn't perfect, but it is truly great. I've just finished the second book in the trilogy, The Well of Ascension, and - again - I'm astounded with his work. His characters are believable, the magic system continues to be impressive, and it is paced well. Regardless of the arguments - Brandon Sanderson is a very good writer. His magic system is original and very, very well thought-out. I recommend the first two books of the Mistborn trilogy to anyone - whether or not you're a fantasy genre fan. Not only are his books fast and fun reading, but they are thought provoking and deep. Just like other landmark series in the sci-fi and fantasy genres, I believe this trilogy will be enjoyed for generations to come. "}, {"Review": " 3.5 StarsOverview:\n\u201cVin isn\u2019t\u2026like other women.\u201d\u201cI think that the more women you come to know, Your Majesty, the more you\u2019ll find that statement applies to all of them.\u201d\nIt\u2019s always hard to write reviews for books I didn\u2019t love or hate. Especially since everyone has such strong feelings about this series. I enjoyed it? I didn\u2019t love it?Pros:Can I be Vin when I grow up? Honestly one of my favorite fantasy heroines ever. This book in particular showed her attempt to balance her femininity with her role as a Mistborn. She exists both as an incredibly violent hero, and a girl in love. She\u2019s allowed the full breadth of human emotions-- jealousy, remorse, happiness, friendship, impulsivity... without being forced into any particular role. This is also shown in Allrianne and Tindwyl, who are both introduced halfway through this, bringing some estrogen to the predominantly male cast. One is frilly and silly, the other hardened and blunt but both are developed characters without being squashed in any particular role. In fact, I enjoyed getting to know most of the characters more. Notably Breeze and OreSeur.I looooooovvvveeeed OreSeur and the role his played in this. The way his relationship with Vin developed was genuine and interesting. Holy plot-twists, Batman. Really enjoyed the way things came together in the end. World-building continues to be fantastic. Everything just adds more depth to the fantastic place Sanderson created. Cons:Everything is so overstated.  This really could have been much shorter, but it all develops so slowwwwwlllllyyyy that there are pages of redundant information. Several times, we are shown character\u2019s thoughts in response to something that happens. But it adds no new information.Examples:  \u201cLord Ruler\u2026 \" Vin thought with shock. He\u2019s one of them\u2014a member of the Church of the Survivor!\u201d\nWhat other tricks was she missing, what other secrets had died with the Lord Ruler?\nA coin shot past her in the air. What! Where did he get that!He was already exhausted, and the alcohol probably wouldn\u2019t help. I can\u2019t afford to fall asleep until I get this done!1. I know the character is a member of the church, because there was a whole passage dedicated to Vin discovering this before her thoughts recap.2. Ominous rhetorical questions don\u2019t make me more curious. 3. I just saw the character use a coin when Vin was certain he didn\u2019t have one, I don\u2019t need her confused thoughts breaking the tension. 4. There\u2019s also been several sentences telling me how tired Elend is, but determined, I don\u2019t need his thoughts too!As it\u2019s a spoiler, I didn\u2019t link it, but there\u2019s one passage where a character points out the dramatic irony of a situation-- just in case you didn\u2019t notice! It\u2019s oversimplifying things. I understand why, because there is a lot going on, and a lot of characters. (Speaking of which, I literally kept forgetting who Dockson and Marsh were they were mentioned so infrequently and neither particularly stood out)But overall, there was just so much time spent on politics and reiterating things I knew, it got boring. In Conclusion: I enjoyed this, there just was too much for it to really click."}], "Image": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1480717596l/68429.jpg", "Desc": "Vin, the street urchin who has grown into the most powerful Mistborn in the land, and Elend Venture, the idealistic young nobleman who loves her, must build a healthy new society in the ashes of an empire. Three separate armies attack. As the siege tightens, an ancient legend seems to offer a glimmer of hope. But even if it really exists, no one knows where to find the Well of Ascension or what manner of power it bestows."}
