{"Genre": "Fantasy", "ID": "29588376", "Name": "The Lies of Locke Lamora", "Reviews": [{"Review": "Back when I was first published, people made a lot of comparisons between me and Scott Lynch. The sentiment was mostly along the lines of \"Pat Rothfuss is the next Scott Lynch!\" Here's the thing, Lies of Lock Lamora had come out almost exactly a year before my first book, The Name of the Wind. It was Scott's first book, the first in a fantasy series. The world was gritty and real, and it had knocked everyone over with how good it was. So I knew it was a flattering comparison, but at the time, I was kinda irked by it. I remember thinking, \"Why do I have to be the next Scott Lynch? Why can't I just be the first Pat Rothfuss? I'll probably be a lot better at that, I've got way more experience at it if nothing else....\" Years later I finally got around to reading Lies and enjoyed it. I saw that it was a clever book, and gritty, with a cool world. And there was an orphan boy in it who was a witty, mouthy thief. A while after that, I met Scott and really liked him as well. So I let go of what little residual irritation I had, not that there was very much... Fast forward to now. This last week I started re-reading Lies, and I was absolutely fucking *stunned* by how good it is. The construction of it. The language. The world. The cleverness. The wit. There is nothing I don't like in this book. Seriously. Okay. Fine. One tiny *tiny* quibble. Even so, do you know how rare it is for me to say that? Right now, in the full flush of this second reading, I think Lies is probably in e in my top ten favorite books ever. Maybe my top five.It's not really fair to compare the two books. They're different styles. Different subjects. Different worlds. That said, here's the things that The Lies of Locke Lamora does better than The Name of the Wind. 1. The beginning of his book is stronger than mine. Seriously. 50 pages into my book, you'll have reached the point where someone is starting to actually tell a story. 50 pages into Lies, you know the main character and are halfway into a fucking heist. 2. His title is better than mine. Don't get me wrong. The Name of the Wind is a good title, it's the *right* title for my book. But \"The Lies of Lock Lamora\" that's a faboo title right there. And his series title is better than mine too. \"Gentleman Bastard\" beats \"Kingkiller Chronicles\" hands-down. 3. His cussing is better than mine. Not in real life. In real life I cuss like a sailor. But the language in my books is pretty genteel and tame. In Lies, Lynch's low-life street thugs are vulgarian virtuosos. This might seem like a little thing, but it's not. It builds the world. It shows character. It helps make the story feel truly, perfectly grubby and real. Here it is in a nutshell: When I was first published, I was irritated when people compared me to Scott Lynch. Only now do I realize how huge a compliment I was being given. If you haven't read it, you should. If you have read it, you should probably read it again.... "}, {"Review": "My legs are so toned from climbing the stairs back to a higher moral ground after reading this book but I would still throw the version of myself who hasn\u2019t picked it up sooner down a set of stairs because this was the most fun I had in a while why did I deprive myself of it? No really. Is anything as pure as a heist book? Is anything as good and exciting and forthright as a heist book, I ask you?\n\nSo, what's this book about?\n\nThe Lies of Locke Lamora, not-so-delicately traces the path back to the past of Locke Lamora, beginning with The Thiefmaker who\u2014after waking up to the realization that the Lamora orphan could be underestimated only at great peril to one\u2019s health\u2014sells him to Chains, the faking Eyeless Priest. Chains takes Locke under his criminal wing in what could only be considered a spectacular act of deathbed vengeance, and for years, he represses Locke\u2019s unrelenting\u2014and oftentimes fatal\u2014capacity for conniving and instead, guides him into cultivating a keenly honed ability to bullshit, wide-eyed and plausibly and at the drop of a hat. Then it travels back to the present day where Locke and his band of oddly pleasant crazy thieves are in the midst of their latest\u2014and biggest\u2014con of the nobility of the land of Camorr.With each successful con, fate\u2019s bowstring seems to be drawing taut and Locke\u2014heck, even the reader\u2014is waiting for the moment when all hell breaks loose. For many pages, hell seems content to stay bound\u2026.until Camorr\u2019s long, dark time tracks Locke down. The newly-arrived Gray King is assassinating gang leaders and the secret police of Camorr's legendary Spider is hunting down Locke.The city of Camorr has upended the board, and Locke Lamora is one of the scattered pieces. Locke soon finds out that one can only get so far on their aptitude to bullshit alone.\n\n\u201cSomeday, Locke Lamora,\u201d he said, \u201csomeday, you\u2019re going to fuck up so magnificently, so ambitiously, so overwhelmingly\u00a0that the sky will light up and the moons will spin and the gods themselves will shit comets with glee. And I just hope I\u2019m still around to see it.\u201d\n\u201cOh please,\u201d said Locke. \u201cIt\u2019ll never happen.\u201d\n\nThe Lies of Locke Lamora is like, a grown-up version of Six of Crows with an enduring sense of larcenous fun, a torrent of polysyllabic profanity and dark madcap humor, but to my eternal dismay...less women. And while Kaz Brekker comes off as a grizzled, hard-bitten, 40-year-old black-and-white film noir anti-hero crammed into the body of a teenager, Locke Lamora is pretty much the opposite...and with much more chill.The story runs non-linearly, jumping back and forth between the past and the present, and shades in between. The effect was disorienting at first as the story sometimes overspills the bounds of its plot and I would often find myself drifting between intrigued and indifferent. But quick as a magician\u2019s sleight of hand, The Lies of Locke Lamora knocks the bottom out of that casual disinterest within a handful of chapters. (A reader\u2019s mileage may, of course, vary on this point.)Those quibbles aside, there's a great deal to enjoy in The Lies of Locke Lamora. The world of Camorr is solidly-crafted and bursting with detail and the vivid, oftentimes violent, action unfolds slowly, propelled by political machinations and anchored in complex character development. It's heavy stuff, full of blood and murder and a terrible clear-eyed certainty that Locke\u2019s reckoning had finally come, but it's leavened by the snarking banter between the leads. (Seriously, this book is hilarious.)The Lies of Locke Lamora also has magic in bounds and mysteries by the minute and the best part is that just when you think you've seen the explosion and let your guard down a little, another one happens. There are moments of victory where I whooped with joy, and there are moments of absolute terror, where everything seems as though it will fall apart. And I think this book works because Locke is such an interesting character, and the author constantly keeps you off guard as to his truths and intent.I also loved how the author never takes the easy way out. He puts many obstacles both physical and emotional in the characters\u2019 path, tortures the hell out of them and makes them better characters for it. Locke is one brilliant son of a bitch\u2014he seems unthreatening and eccentric, until one understood what deep power lay behind his frail facade. However, he\u2019s not beyond going under, pulled along by currents he can\u2019t control and do not understand, carried out to a larger, unknown sea. And I think that\u2019s where this book was more successful than Six of Crows: the world did not always bend to Locke Lamora, it did not always fit into his order of things and that felt a lot more realistic.\n\u201cTo us \u2014 richer and cleverer than everyone else!\u201d\u00a0\nI personally think this was triumph of a novel. I never know where Lynch is going to take us, in this world of thieves and blood and revenge, but I am more than happy to continue along the journey with him!\u00a0BLOG | TWITTER | INSTAGRAM | TUMBLR"}, {"Review": "Ocean's Eleven was great and everything, but know what would've made it cooler? If the setting had been during the late middle ages, possibly the Renaissance. Better yet, a fantasy world version of the Renaissance with an intricate system of magic and a complex set of political conspiracies to add some flair. And what if the city was built upon the ruins of an earlier city, and the earlier city was built by some enigmatic science fiction creatures that have since disappeared? And if instead of a handsome, tepid and understated George Clooney in the lead, we had a short guy who can't swordfight a whit, and has a bit of an anger management issue? And he drops unexpected one-liners that make you literally laugh out loud while you're in the breakroom at work and suddenly everyone is looking at you like you're psycho? What if the character went to the Mel Gibson school of Masochism, requiring he gets beat to a bloody pulp and stabbed and drowned in horse urine...oh, I don't know....several times per story arc? How about this character (we'll call him Locke) is absolutely fallible and occasionally screws up on a cosmic level? The kind of screw-up that would get someone less clever killed in mere seconds? And what if, improbably, this protagonist somehow escapes and still--in a manner of speaking--wins? That sounds like fun. But, it COULD end up a little predictable. So, the author should be a recent graduate of the George R R Martin School of Bumping Off Prominent Characters (Yes, these schools do exist). And the con game Locke is building should hit tons of snags that continue raising the stakes and drawing in new, more dangerous characters, increasing the risk until you just can't stop reading even to put out house fires for the last couple hundred pages. And then, when somehow the Gentlemen Bastards emerge on the other side, coated in their own blood and the blood of others, triumphant, you put the book down and say \"Wow.\" Furthermore! How about, even though the book is the first book in a ridiculously long series, this hypothetical book is a complete story! (For those of you who read a lot of Very Long Fantasy Serieses, this may be a foreign concept. It may help to wiki the words \"climax\" and \"resolution.\") When you finish this one, you aren't forced to keep reading in order to find out how the conflict is resolved. You actually know. That sounds pretty cool. Well, it is cool. It is witty, profane, violent, over the top, and frequently hilarious. I can't believe this is Scott Lynch's first novel, and I can't wait to read more. This is an incredibly fun adventure novel. Find yourself a copy and read it."}, {"Review": "So, I was surprised to discover we owned this book, since it's a very well known book but nobody in my house had ever mentioned it to me.Turns out my wife bought it, tried it, found it too slow, and gave up. I've convinced her to give it another go.I enjoyed Locke Lamora and his lies quite a bit. Immediately I liked the writing, which combines wit with solid prose. Like my wife I hit a bit of a soft patch early on, though for me it was that I was finding the point of view very 'surface' sharing almost nothing of Locke's thoughts or desires, leaving him a bit of a blank. Lots of fantasy fans quite like a blank to project themselves onto - but I'm not one of them. Fortunately Locke's personality continued to develop and the point of view seemed to settle a little deeper into him as things progressed.The real strengths of the book are the plotting, the dialogue, and the atmosphere. The dialogue (banter) brings the Gentlemen Bastards to life, the plotting keeps the reader on their toes, and the city is very well imagined.I was surprised to find that the light-hearted tone (set primarily by the banter between Locke's gang) actually allows a slew of quite dark themes/scenes to slide past with less impact than they might have. The child prostitution, the gruesome torture scenes, and the mutilation dealt out by our hero are all absent in my own d\u00e9but which is often called out for being very dark.In any event, I found it to be a rewarding read, well written, and entertaining. I'd recommend any fantasy fan to give it a try.Join my 3-emails-a-year newsletter #prizes..."}, {"Review": "The Lies of Locke Lamora is a love child of Ocean's Eleven and The Godfather. With blood, deaths, betrayals, money, and drowning in horse urine. With a sh*tload of non-PG humor. All for the price of one. And it's SO. GOOD.\n\n\u201cSome day, Locke Lamora,\u201d he said, \u201csome day, you\u2019re going to fuck up so magnificently, so ambitiously, so overwhelmingly that the sky will light up and the moons will spin and the gods themselves will shit comets with glee. And I just hope that I\u2019m still around to see it.\u201d\n\n-----------------------------------------------------Warning: If you are not a fan of strong language, you should back away slowly from this book. It gleefully takes the f-bombs and casually throws them around. But, as the author has mentioned before, foul language is the least issue of this book full of violence, blood, and drowning in horse piss. Regardless, consider yourselves warned.------------------------------------------------------------Add the above together, and you have Camorr. A lovely place to raise children.-------------------------------------------------------------Locke Lamora, our lovable antihero, would like you to believe he's nothing more than a petty thief. Well, not so much. He is the Thorn of Camorr, puling one heist after another on the unsuspecting, secure in their birth nobles of his medieval Venice-like city. Until one day he gets in way over his head. There are plenty of people who would love to see him dead - if they could ever figure out who the hell he is. \n\"There\u2019s no freedom quite like the freedom of being constantly underestimated.\"\n Locke Lamora is a Gentleman Bastard who doesn't care much about becoming rich. So why does he steal on a truly grandiose scale? Of course, \n\"because it's heaps of fucking fun.\"\n And because he is not a fan of nobles feeling invincible just because they are nobles. He loves being a Thorn in their side and giving them the taste of their own medicine.\n\"Sometimes I think this whole city was put here simply because the gods must adore crime. Pickpockets rob the common folk, merchants rob anyone they can dupe, Capa Barsavi robs the robbers and the common folk, the lesser nobles rob nearly everyone, and Duke Nicovante occasionally runs off with his army and robs the shit out of Tal Verarr or Jerem, not to mention what he does to his own nobles and his common folk.\u201d \n Locke is a proverbial smartass. He is stubborn, clever, and disrespectful. Basically, he has a knack for attracting trouble. After all, someone has already paid for his death before Locke even turned eight. He is not so great with weapons - unless you count wits, sheer tenacity, and enormous disrespect for authority. What he IS great with is friendship. He gets by with a little help from his friends, so to say.\n\u201cI don't have to beat you. I don't have to beat you, motherfucker. I just have to keep you here... until Jean shows up.\u201d \n Locke Lamora has only one BERSERK BUTTON (unless you also count a certain redhead) - \nDO.NOT.MESS.WITH.HIS.FRIENDS.\n Seriously, you don't want Locke Lamora pissed at you. (view spoiler)[Just ask the Gray King. (hide spoiler)] And that's what I really adored about this book - the depiction of honest, strong friendships between Locke and his gang. Formerly a bunch of misfits, they have formed strong bonds of friendship that will only be broken by death. They always have each other's back, no matter what the situation is. Locke and Jean Tannen have the best bromance ever since Joey and Chandler or Turk and JD.-------------------------------------------------------------------------I loved this book - so much I want to have grandbabies with it. It's a fun, fast-paced, skillfully written, smart and snarky but surprisingly touching read that had me laughing and shaking my fist in anger within a few pages. Easy 5 stars for the enjoyable ride. \n\u201cI can't wait to have words with the Gray King when this shit is all finished,\" Locke whispered. \"There's a few things I want to ask him. Philosophical questions. Like, 'How does it feel to be dangled out a window by a rope tied around your balls, motherfucker?\u201d \n"}, {"Review": "4.5/5 StarsDouble Fuckdamn\u20261. For postponing reading this book for a really long time. 2. For underestimating Scott Lynch\u2019s capability to create such a strong debut novel.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no freedom quite like the freedom of being constantly underestimated.\u201d\n\nTogether with The Name of the Wind by Patrick Rothfuss and Malice by John Gwynne, The Lies of Locke Lamora, the first book in The Gentleman Bastard Sequence series is one of the best DEBUT novels I ever read. Don\u2019t get me wrong, the series I mentioned are completely different with each other but in terms of debut quality, I love and praise them equally.Picture: Locke Lamora overlooking the city of CamorrThe plot of the book started out slow and at the same time, with a bang. Following a group of elite con artists called The Gentleman Bastards, lead by their leader Locke Lamora (the infamous Thorn of Camorr), the story begins with the gang trying to pull off the biggest heist they ever attempted before eventually getting caught up in something much bigger than they signed up for. At first, the book is really full of dark humor and may seem light-hearted but then as the story progressed, the undertone of the story became darker as the plot\u2019s complexity and intensity grew gradually leading towards a marvelous climax sequence. Scott Lynch has created a multi-layered story filled with the whole package required for a masterpiece within one book, I really think this book could work great as a standalone but for it to be a series? it's really a fucking bonus. Although this book is highly plot driven, please don\u2019t let this trick you into thinking that the characters aren\u2019t well written or scarce in development.The book is structured in a similar way to \u2018The Kingkiller Chronicle\u2019 where the narrative shifts between the \u2018present\u2019 and \u2018past\u2019 sections. However, contrary to KKC, this situation happened really often and Scott Lynch used the interludes as the \u2018past\u2019 sections. These interludes are at the end of almost every chapter and it\u2019s where all the character background, personality, developments and some aspects of the world-building were explored. The juxtaposition of these two narratives created a superlative result in bringing not only a greatly written story but also a very addictive pacing. Seriously, it started out a bit slow but after around 100 pages mark, it was pretty much impossible to stop reading as the plot thickens. I actually read 300 pages of the book in a day right after getting back from work, sleeping hours were sacrificed and did I regret it? No, I\u2019ll gladly do it again during my reread of this book.Picture: The Gentleman Bastards up to no good. (French edition cover)The Gentleman Bastards is probably one of the most compelling gangs I ever had the pleasure of knowing out of every medium I ever experienced. Consisting of six members who were trained by Father Chains, Locke Lamora, the garrista (leader) of the group, Jean Tannen, the brute, Calo and Galdo Sanza, the jack-of-all-trades identical twins, Bug, the overlooked young apprentice and Sabetha (doesn\u2019t make an appearance in the book), their genius schemes, brotherhood, and interactions is an immensely fun experience to read. Within the first 100 pages and I'm already in love with the members of the gang already. It\u2019s an also rare occurrence that I literally laughed out loud during the usual high fantasy books I read but these characters managed to do it several times throughout the book with their amazingly humorous banter. I was going to put a quote here but I seriously think it\u2019s better for you to find out by yourself, they\u2019re all golden.Picture: The Gentleman Bastards in Camorr (Japanese edition cover)I need to give a bit of a reminder about Scott Lynch\u2019s prose. There\u2019s a myriad of swearing, cursed words, and mockery I never even had the imagination to ever think of, this book is pretty much infested with them. I personally love them because believe it or not, they\u2019re really eloquent, full of sass and apt for the overall story and setting of the book. The prose in every factor of the book is very intricate, the heists, the BLOODY actions, the dialogues, politics but most of all, it\u2019s really evident in the world-building aspect.I can\u2019t stress this highly enough, the world-building in this book is REALLY detailed. The entire setting of the book took place in the city of Camorr, which is clearly based on medieval Venice with its canals and lights that illuminate the city during a period of night time called Falselight. The setting itself, mixed with elements of fantasy is really gorgeous and breathtaking. With the addition of the bloody history of Camorr, the stylish fashions and the intricate description on food and liquors appearances and tastes, Scott Lynch did a really fantastic job in its world-building. However, this is also the only factor in the book where I had a minor problem with. Some of the world-building aspects can be really info dumpy and they're spread throughout the book that it hurts the pacing a bit when it happened cause I should reread the paragraph sometimes. Luckily, when it\u2019s there, it\u2019s always only for a short section before the pacing is back in full throttle again so it doesn't really hurt my overall experience.I could tell you that this book is overrated or it doesn\u2019t meet my expectation but that statement would be called \u2018The Lies of Petrik Leo\u2019 since right now, not only that I personally think it deserved the fame it gets, The Lies of Locke Lamora is one of the best debut novels I ever read. It will be really hard for the rest of the series to top this one but I'm eager to find out, soon after posting this review. Hopefully, the rest of the series will continue to awe me the same with its ingenious content that never fails to steal my attention from cover to cover. This is a great tale of avarice and brotherhood you don't want to miss and I absolutely recommend this for every reader of adult high fantasy that\u2019s looking for something original, engrossing, bloody and fun in their read.\nSide note: Locke Lamora is one of the best name I ever heard in my entire life.\nYou can find this and the rest of my Adult Epic/High Fantasy & Sci-Fi reviews at Booknest"}, {"Review": "2.5 stars...maybe a full 3?I'm having such a hard time with how I feel about this book!I was looking for another fantasy/heist book like The Palace Job, and The Lies of Locke Lamora has so many great reviews that I thought it would be an easy win for me.Ehhh. Yes and no. But mostly no.Let me be the first to admit that the problems I had with this one?Well, they might be exactly why every other reader loved it. It took me forever to get through this. It felt like years went by while I tried to get to The Good Stuff. I know that a lot of you love books that give detailed descriptions of the character's surroundings. I know, I know, I know!Please, for the love of God, don't spam my review thread with your comments on how I just don't understand the beauty of the lush world Lynch built.I most certainly do understand, but I don't enjoy reading about what material a character's coat is made out of unless it will somehow be relevant later on in the story.Here's my rule on this sort of thing:Unless the fact that the gently swaying purple flower's fragrance made WhoTheFuckEver do/say/remember something important that will move the plot forward?Well, then I don't even need to know that there was a fucking purple flower!And, yes, I do like the world I'm reading about to feel complete and real, but there's only so much I can (personally) take.This book tested my patience.There was so much...just irrelevant crap on every page that I started skimming in earnest by the 50% mark. I hate skimming, because I always think I'm going to miss something, but I had to do it, or I would never have finished.Another thing that bothered me were all the fucking flashbacks.Because EVERY TIME shit would start to get interesting, you'd have to go back and read about their childhoods. That would have been fine, \nif\n all of these flashbacks were interesting. They weren't.It was a 50/50 split between relevant stories of their past and boring bullshit filler that had a speck of pertinent information. So.The core of the story is clever, funny, charming, heart-wrenching, and fun...once you scrape away about half of the words.I mean, the plot would easily have made this a 5 star book for me. EASILY!It's well-written, it's lovely, it made me feel things!But when I went to request the next book, I found myself sort of shuddering at the thought of slogging through any more of these guys' adventures.I'm not the kind of reader who can truly enjoy this kind of book, but maybe you are? There are lots of glowing reviews for this one, so take my opinion with a grain of salt."}, {"Review": "Lynch introduces us to a gang of intelligent, flamboyant and charismatic thieves called the Gentleman Bastards around whom this book (and I assume the entire series) revolves. Locke - the infamous Thorn of Camorr, Jean and Bug were my personal favourites within the group but the camaraderie presented surrounding the gang was amazing - almost making us as the reader feel part of the ensemble - as we were privy to the cons, the secrets and also the stories revolving the characters youths.Lynch presents his chapters in a way that shows two timelines. Typically a chronologic present day portrayal of what the Gentleman Bastards are doing in Camorr's underworld and then various origin stories such as Locke's induction to the group and Jean's training at weaponry. The origin stories usually feed quite nicely into what then takes place in the current day or explain part of the world/ cultural references. It is majorly written third person focusing on Locke but it does flip and switch between following a handful of other characters too. It took me a while to get in to initially as we are thrown straight into the world which has numerous races, religions and underworld hierarchy but after about 30-40 I was under the spell. Some of the cons are mesmerising. I remember numerous times when I thought that the con couldn't get any more complex or multi-layered it did and I was left in awe. It consists of a colourful supporting cast including some of the Capa's (gang leaders), Father Chains and the Grey King. It has quite a few shocking moments where some characters are killed off. It is a pretty gruesome world and a few deaths and scenes of torture made me go wow - pretty grim. The ending was very rewarding and I cannot wait to start reading Red Seas Under Red Skies. I think most of my friends on Goodreads have read this but if you haven't then I truly recommend it. James x www.youandibooks.wordpress.com"}, {"Review": "I'll be blunt up front and share that The Lies of Locke Lamora is one of my favorite books this year.I loved it. Ever freaking word of every line. While the main plot of the book features heist, treachery and more mutinies than you could shake a stick at \u2013 the heart of the novel lies in the epic bromance that is the Gentlemen Bastards. I am a huge fan of the \u2018family that you choose yourself\u2019 trope, so Locke and his gang of misfits tickled at my heartstrings. Make no mistake, they\u2019re neither gentle or loving to one another \u2013 preferring to trade insults to niceties. Yet, through flashbacks and banter, the reader could feel the camaraderie between Locke and each of the member in his team. Morally ambiguous characters who look out for their own? Basically a set up after my own heart.The world-building laid the foundation to a much richer world which I am excited to explore in future books. The city of Camorr is loosely based on a medieval Venice, with once charming waterways turned sinister by presence of vicious sharks and the shadow of the criminal underworld. The city was another character unto itself, treacherous and filled with secrets. I also loved seeing the rise and fall of rival gangs, and how Locke navigated the bureaucracy of criminal societies with poise.Although most of the book was wildly entertaining, I appreciated that The Lies of Locke Lamora dared to go to dark places and take difficult roads. It would have been so easy to make Locke and the Gentlemen Bastards own all their exploits and emerge grinning. Yet, the plot throws many wrenches in Locke\u2019s best laid plans, and the death toll is shockingly high for a book that started all banter and petty tricks. I liked that our protagonists were in true danger at some point, and they definitely did not emerge unscathed.In all, this is the type of book that any author should strive to write. And it Lynch's first."}, {"Review": "Hello my dears, is it a mentally decapitating book you wish to read? (Pun intended)Come, come right this way.............This book is exactly what you're looking for, IF you're looking for a fantasy riddled, ruthless, enigmatic piece of art. This book was that, and so much more. This book is around 700 pages with apt descriptions and precise detailing. It revolves around an orphan thief (because that's the best kind), whose world is changed when a plague riddled village is left with its only unaffected survivors. Based on the synopsis and the limited knowledge I had of this book before I picked it up, I assumed locke's thieving life will begin after he is taken into the custody of the thief lord, but boy was I mistaken. Locke is the story of a boy who has long before the story begins, been selected or better yet said; chosen for a life as a thief. Ironically a decent thief. You see the reason this book deserves praise isn't the fastidious writing or plotting, it's the way the author has taken a heinous act such as stealing and transformed it into an art, and better yet made us absolutely love the so called artist. Its a mixture of tragic circumstances and incredible wit, with a touch of unbidden morality that makes his protagonist who he is. I guess it's always the way one person stands out as extraordinary that makes heads turn their way, and emotions ebb and flow. But perhaps my favorite thing was the fact that he wasn't invincible, he was smart, but not impossibly so. I guess I just fell in love with Locke from the beginning, he was just so imperfectly perfect. There is a renown sense of honesty to him, making him lovable. The book moves back and forth, between different events in different settings and time spans. Keeping up with the flow proved to be a little difficult at first, because of all the names and places and people, and this jumping from here to there didn't help much either. But truly once you get into the flow of the book, which takes about 50 or so pages, you just sink, and keep going deeper and deeper. I personally adored the touches from locke's childhood and his learning, but it wasn't just about him. The book has a way of keeping you guessing, not just about what happens next, but also about who plays what role, and who truly matters. Although I give fair warning, this books is no happily ever after, and definitely not romance riddled. There are characters mentioned all through out, but have yet to be introduced, I personally want to meet locke's lost love sooner rather than later, but that has yet to happen.Like I said before, the book doesn't revolve solely around one person, regardless of the fact that he is the main protagonist. Some parts shocked me to the core, and way too many characters were lost is a short span. Nascza was my first stab to the gut, then came bug, the twin priests, and all the others that just kept adding to the pile. I particularly mourned Bug. That was so not okay Mr.lynch, so not okay! But regardless of the gut stabbing pain, the book was a thrill, and excellently written. It was my first time reading anything of lynchs work, and I dare say I was impressed. Although his vividly descriptive writing takes some getting used to. Can wait to read the second book!!!"}, {"Review": "5 Holy shit what did I just read Stars.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\n\u275dI only steal because it\u2019s heaps of fucking fun!\u275e\n\n\n\"You can\u2019t be serious. This crap is as welcome as a pile of severed dog cocks.\u201d\nFirstly this book was incredible, seriously i can't even think of words to describe how good it was. This was my first time reading anything by Scott Lynch and I'm really impressed, he is a fantastic author and extremely talented. I'm so glad I picked up this book. I enjoyed it from page one, although I must admit it took me over 100 pages to understand what was going on, this story is written in past & present, so the chapters can be really confusing at the beginning. After getting used to Scotts writing style I was blown away, I feel like it's nearly impossible to pull off a book with past & present chapters especially when it jumps around a lot, but Scott Lynch managed pulled it off. The plot is slow paced but builds up to a massive story, normally not my cup of tea because it doesn't have much violence or magic in the plot but still the definition of badassery! Oceans Eleven meets The Bank Job meets Mistborn. Seriously this book was so much fun to read. I love gangsters and I love criminals so with the complex plot, this book was a 10/10.\n\n\u201cHard lessons were handed out. As many men learned to their sorrow, it\u2019s impossible to be intimidating when one angry woman has your cock between her teeth and another is holding a stiletto to your kidneys.\u201d\n\nThis book is on my favourite shelf and in my top five favourite books ever. I literally loved reading it. I was so captivated by the plot & the characters. I read some of the reviews for this book and saw a lot of people complaining about the amount of swearing.... The swearing made it hilarious and I loved it so much. Scott Lynch literally swears in every sentence (just like me haha). I can't remember ever laughing so much in a fantasy book. Only had one issue it felt really long, like some description went on and on, some also weren't necessary at all. Yes Scott Lynch is a beautiful and interesting world builder, however some parts just went over the top, I did skim a lot of descriptions, except characters and important scenes.\n\n\u201cHaven\u2019t you ever heard that one before? Your Capa Barsavi, he\u2019s not from Camorr, originally. Taught at the Therin Collegium. So, when he drags someone in for a talking-to, that\u2019s \u2018etiquette lessons.\u2019 And when he ties them up and makes them talk, that\u2019s \u2018singing lessons.\u2019 And when he cuts their throats and throws them in the bay for the sharks\u2026\u201d\u201cOh,\u201d said Jean, \u201cI guess that\u2019d be teeth lessons. I get it.\u201d\n\nSo basically this book is about gangs, there are all different gangs and they are all under one leader the Capa, the gangs each have a leader but the leaders work under the Capa and must pay him to keep their gangs running. The story follows a gang called the gentlemans bastards, all members are orphans and are all trained to be gentleman & the best theifs around. Our main character Locke is a professional liar & the story follows him and his childhood. I absolutely adore Locke, he is everything I look for in a character he is badass, a liar, a criminal & a thief but he is also such a gentleman (swoon worthy). So basically Locke and his gang try to pull off one of the biggest thievery jobs ever, however it doesn't go to plan and their is a new gang boss on the scene thirsty for revenge.\n\n\u201cA manifestation straight from the ass of a magnificent liar,\u201d\n\nI literally adored all characters in this book and cried a few times at the brutality they go through. The Bromance between Locke and Jean had me. It was so genuine. I think most of my favourite parts where from Jeans POV I loved his training, I loved when he chose his weapons (the sisters) and I loved a certain battle towards the end with him vs two people. It was so badass and Jean is my precious.\n\n\u201c\u2026 and this is the card you picked. The six of spires,\u201d said Calo, holding up a card and displaying it for the entrance-hall guards.\u201cFuck me,\u201d said one of them, \u201cthat\u2019s sorcery.\u201d \u201cNah, it\u2019s just the old Sanza touch.\u201d\n\nI recommend this book to all fantasy lovers and also people who like Mafia books with a twist. I think this book would be a great introduction for anyone wanting to start reading fantasy. P.S. When I grow up I want to be in the gentlemen's bastards. \u201cChains used to claim that there\u2019s no freedom quite like the freedom of being constantly underestimated,\u201d said Locke.\u201cGods, yes.\u201d Calo rolled his eyes and stuck out his tongue. \u201cIf we were any freer we\u2019d float away into the sky and fly like the birds.\u201d"}, {"Review": "THERE ARE NOT ENOUGH STARS IN THE SKY TO ACCURATELY SUM UP MY LOVE FOR THIS BOOK. I'm actually DYING WITH ADORATION RIGHT NOW. Can I say this is the best book ever???? Like, seriously, if I could only pick like 5 top books, it would be in that 5. (And omg peoples I read hundreds of books per year and am a rabid fan of many.) This was just frikkin brilliant in every. single. possible. way. I HAVE EMOTIONS. And I laughed so much because it's absolutely hilarious and clever and witty and insanely clever and did I mention how clever it is yet??!?I love this book. Just in case you needed that to be cleared up a bit.NOTE: I listened to the audio and 10/10 looooved it. Narrator was amazing, although I still played it at 2x the speed because I'm an impatient little bean.WHERE DO I EVEN START?!?!? Okay, how about, a short list of everything perfect about this book?\u2022 it's about heists and con artists\u2022 it's set in an Italian (Spanish? both?) inspired fantasy world\u2022 Locke is a sassy little bastard who is SO CLEVER but honestly spends 98% of the time admiring his own wit\u2022 it has my new favourite brotip of the world\u2022 the plot weaves things together so clever I died\u2022 it absolutely MANGLED MY FEELS\u2022 there is magic\u2022 and psychopaths galore\u2022 it gets seriously bloody and stabby SO MUCH WHICH IS GREAT\u2022 #ISwearImNormal\u2022 I laughed. I cried. I laugh/cried. I died.\u2022 LOCKE IS MY DARLING.One thing I can't flail about enough is the WRITING. It was constantly smart and concise and often had really short chapters that packed a grand punch. And it had little cliffhangers ALL OVER THE PLACE which slayed me 100% of the time. I mean, they were kind of annoying?? Like it'd leave Locke in a precarious dangerous deathly position and then flash back to something in his childhood or like narrate the origin of the history of handball. I know. HANDBALL. Like SHUT UP AND STOP PROCRASTINATING. But these little tidbits were interesting and did actually flesh out the world a lot...aaaand, they totally created so much tension and addiction that I couldn't put the book down. Well, put my headphones down. Ever. THEY ARE GLUED TO MY HEAD OMG.And the world building was fantastic! I could totally SEE Camora (shh, I have no idea how to spell it!? audiobook remember) and I loved the intense details that just brought the place to life.And Locke is, no joke, the BEST character of my life. He was simultaneously clever, witty and capable...and also like a pathetic little thin child who got into very terrible danger and needed to be rescued constantly by Jean. I CANNOT LOVE LOCKE ENOUGH. He sassed at all the wrong times. Like, dude, you are getting your face beaten in SHUT UP. But no.\u201cI cut off his fingers to get him to talk, and when he'd confessed everything I wanted to hear, I had his fucking tongue cut out, and the stump cauterized.\"Everyone in the room stared at him.\"I called him an asshole, too,\" said Locke. \"He didn't like that.\u201d He also needs Jean so bad and their friendship is actual goals. I mean, Jean would cross oceans and kill a thousand sharks and fly to the moon and back and be nearly murdered -- AND HE'D STILL COME AND SAVE LOCKE. Whereas Locke gets beaten up and he just lies in the dirt until Jean saves him. #preciousNot to mention all the other Gentlemen Bastards. I loooved the twins, Carlo and Galdo (heaven help me with the spelling??) who finished each other's sentences and were clever and hilarious at ALL TIMES. And Bug was the 12 year old apprentice and he was adorable and stupid and therefore a perfect Gentlemen Bastard. (That's the name of their con group by the way.) AND THEY WERE ALL LIKE BROTHERS AND LIKE FAMILY AND I LOVED THEM.The plot was obviously A+. Because it was so clever. There are dozens of cons and small subplots that just wrap into each other PERFECTLY by the end that I was sitting there like a drowned avocado saying \"why can't I write like this\".And my feels? HAHAHAH WHAT FEELS. They've been mangled. I don't even know how to fix them. Duct tape? I'm gonna need duct tape.I CAN'T EVEN GET OVER HOW MUCH I LOVE LOCKE THOUGH. Perfect little arrogant and cocky and twitchy and absolutely in-over-his-head-at-all-times little mite. I have such a weakness for thieves and sass and I got BOTH in GREAT ABUNDANCE here and I'm in love. Also crying but whatever.And I have such a book hangover... YES it's a thing. I have the sequel on library reserve but IT'S NOT IN MY HANDS RIGHT. THIS. MINUTE. Ergo I am dyyyyyying. It only took one book, but I'm successfully Locke Lamora trash and I'm not even ashamed. I'm just, like, SCREAMING because it was so so so so freakishly good. It was everything I want in a book. I THINK I'M SUFFOCATING WITH ADORATION RIGHT NOW.\u201cYou've got that motherly concern in your eyes, Jean. I must look like I'm hammered as shit,\" said Locke.\"Actually you look like you were executed last week.\u201d "}, {"Review": "Some books evoke a distinctive feeling, or atmosphere, that can only be associated with that said book. This is no less true for The Lies of Lock Lamora by Scott Lynch. From the very early on I knew what kind of stuff this would be about, and how gritty it was going to become. Indeed, this book turns into a violent mess. That\u2019s because the ancient city of Camorr is infested with thieves, pickpockets, schemers and violent gang leaders. But, the worse of the bunch is the priests. Father Chains is a priest and his money making scheme is as brilliant as it is conniving. He hides behind a false religion and has created a fake temple to its worship. He pretends to be a prophet; thus, he rakes in a considerable income in tithes. He keeps the money for himself, and lives in luxury. To add insult to injury he also pretends to be blind, which further increases sympathy for himself and weighs down his pockets more so. Chains becomes Locke\u2019s mentor. Suffice to say, he has learnt from the best thief of the age.  He was raised to be a thiefLocke Lamora (sounds good to say doesn\u2019t it) is a young prodigy out to steal the world; he is ambitious and clever, strong and resourceful, and he has set his mind to a heist that will topple all those that came before it. He is the leader of Chain\u2019s Gentleman Bastards, which is a thief syndicate that uses every tool available. These include things from a simple cutpurse job to blending in with the nobility. They were all raised by Chains; they are all master thieves, and the heist they attempt is bigger than the dreams any common thief. Well, you know what they say about those that fly too high: they end up in a sticky mess. The Gentleman Bastards certainly achieved that. During their scheming they crossed paths with someone rather ominous, someone who wishes to use them in his revenge field mission against the entire city of Camoor. He has discovered the plans of Locke and friends and is using it to manipulate them to help in his blood soaked quest. Woe to Locke Lamora for this man has hired the help of someone rather dangerous: a feared bondsmage.  Some great action The result is one big bloody mess that the author has thoughtfully devised. He has written in very well too, for the most part, although there are a few moments when his prose goes overboard. Don\u2019t get me wrong, he describes some things with real eloquent detail, but others are just in too much depth. I remember reading a paragraph long description of a barrel of ale at one point. This was completely unnecessary. However, when these in depth description are applied to a combat scene the result is fantastic. This is my only criticism for the novel, and if they were toned a little I would have enjoyed the book a little more. Overall, this is a great fantasy novel that is unlike any others I\u2019ve read. This is always good because the genre can be littered with books that simply follow the standard fantasy archetype, which results in repetitive story telling. This isn\u2019t necessarily bad, but can become boring after a while. Therefore, the plot of this is fresh, exciting and completely new. A good solid 3.5 stars. "}, {"Review": "\u25ba BR with the BBB gang starting January 11, 2016.\u2620 DNF at 31% \u2620Warning: I pretty much have nothing to say about this book. Does it mean my review will be short? Now now, people, don't be so na\u00efve. Okay, let's do some quick maths here. I read the first 31% of this book. This book is 752 pages long (it feels like it's 2,500 pages long, but don't tell anyone I said that). Which means I read about 230 pages of this Delightful Piece of Fast-Paced Awesomeness (DPFPA\u2122). Which means I should have something to tell you about it. But I don't. Because nothing happened. Apart from a bunch of thieves planning some kind of con-type thing. Is that vague enough for you? Good. Now don't ask me what kind of con-type thing it was, because after 230 pages, I still freaking haven't a freaking clue. It's got to do something with some fascinating noble guy named Don Lorenzo Salvara. And that's pretty much all I know about it. Why? Because the author was so busy drowning his main plot in irrelevant crap that he forgot he had an actual story to tell. But I wouldn't want to be completely unfair here (and as you all know, I am fairness incarnate), so I will admit that yes, one thing did happen. I know you don't believe me, but I swear it's the truth. Want to know what happened? Lamora got on a boat. Yep, that's right. I know it's a lot to take, but please try and refrain from fainting. Have you recovered? I hope so, because I just remembered something else happened. No no no, don't pass out again! Stay with me! Just take a few deep breaths and it will be alright. Feel better? Phew, that was close. So, \"what else happened,\" you ask? Some gladiator-type chick got eaten by some sharks. Yeah, that was pretty cool. I enjoyed every single second of that scene. That scene was amazing. Think of it as 5 glorious seconds of utter awesomeness. Scott Lynch, you overachiever. 5 whole seconds! This is just too much. You shouldn't overexert yourself like this, I'm pretty sure it's hazardous to your health. Come to think of it, I shouldn't worry about you. I mean, 98% of this book 31% of this book is filler BS, adorned with Agonizingly Interminable Descriptions from Inferno (AIDI\u2122) and enhanced with Excruciatingly Detailed Prose from Hell (EDPH\u2122). Yep, that's right, excitement is me \u2622 sarcasm alert \u2622 And that is all. I have nothing else to say about this book. BUT. I'd hate to see you go so soon, so I shall (very generously, I might add) share my Delightful Lamora Reading Experience (DLRE\u2122) with you. I suffered through 31% of this, there's no reason why you shouldn't suffer through this review as well. Please don't thank me, I'm generous like that.\u00bb So. When I first read the blurb for this book, I was all:Which loosely translates to: OMG this sounds so cool, I should buddy read it with my Silly Friends of Despicable Book Taste (view spoiler)[I love you too (hide spoiler)]!!!!\u00bb Then I very happily and very naively started reading. And this happened: blah blah blah, skim skim skim, blah blah blah, skim skim skim, blah blah blah, skim skim skim, blah blah blah, skim skim skim, blah blah blah, skim skim skim, blah blah blah, skim skim skim, blah blah blah, skim skim skim, blah blah blah, skim skim skim.Blah blah blah, skim skim skim, blah blah blah, skim skim skim, blah blah blah, skim skim skim, blah blah blah, skim skim skim, blah blah blah, skim skim skim, blah blah blah, skim skim skim, blah blah blah, skim skim skim, blah blah blah, skim skim skim. Blah blah blah, skim skim skim, blah blah blah, skim skim skim, blah blah blah, skim skim skim, blah blah blah, skim skim skim, blah blah blah, skim skim skim, blah blah blah, skim skim skim, blah blah blah, skim skim skim, blah blah blah, skim skim skim. \u00bb Oops, sorry, it looks like the Fairness Police just caught me in the act again (see how they stop me the slow-mo way? That just goes to show how faithful they are to the author's style). Okay, so I have to admit that in the middle of all this blah-blah-blah-ing and skim-skim-skimming, this sometimes happened: ha ha ha ha ha, great dialogue, ha ha ha ha ha, great dialogue, ha ha ha ha ha, great dialogue, ha ha ha ha ha, great dialogue, ha ha ha ha ha, great dialogue. But I'm afraid Lynch's 5-second rule applies here as well. So we were back in blah blah blah, skim skim skim land in less time than it takes to blink.Oh, no need to remind Mr Lynch about that. Believe me, HE KNOWS.Blah blah blah, skim skim skim, blah blah blah, skim skim skim, blah blah blah, skim skim skim, blah blah blah, skim skim skim, blah blah blah, skim skim skim, blah blah blah, skim skim skim, blah blah blah, skim skim skim, blah blah blah, skim skim skim. REPEAT. REPEAT. REPEAT. \u00bb And that, ladies and gentlemen, is how I ended up DNFing this thrilling piece of captivating literature. Oh believe me, I know I read it all wrong, blah blah blah, skim skim skim and all that crap. Well let me tell you something: if some of my dear friends hadn't waited for me to DNF this to tell me the first half of the book was boring as hell (you don't say?!) but that the second half was awesome, maybe I would have kept on reading. And maybe, just maybe, I would be ooh-ing and aah-ing about this right now \u2190 you don't really believe any of this, do you? Oh good, you scared me there for a second. I mean boring crap is boring crap, no matter how you look at it.\u25ba\u25ba And the moral of this non-review is: hey, I think I've just achieved something here! I think I just wrote a blah blah blah, skim skim skim review! Damn, I can be so gifted sometimes. You better watch out, Mr Lynch, your glorious days as Ruthless Ruler of Blah Blah Blah Skim Skim Skim Land are over. I'm out to get you."}, {"Review": "Another great fantasy, this novel follows a talented rogue and conman, Locke Lamora, through his adventures in Camorr, a city loosely patterned after Venice, but set in a world where humans have built their society over the ruins of a much older race called the Eldren. Locke rises from an orphaned beggar to become one of the most wanted thieves in the city, and along the way makes some enemies in very high places \u2013 the Duke\u2019s head of secret police, \u2018the Spider,\u2019 the capa of the city\u2019s underworld (who doesn\u2019t approve of targeting the city\u2019s nobles) and a new player in town, the Gray King, who has his own deadly agenda, along with some unbeatable magic backup. Lynch\u2019s world is so vivid and fully formed that the reader feels as if he\u2019s been dropped into the crowded bazaar in an exotic city and left to find his way out. At first, this can be overwhelming. Everything is different: the days of the week, the gods, the geography, the slang. On top of this, Lynch jumps back and forth in time from Locke Lamora\u2019s past to his present. I confess I got bogged down at the beginning and had to come back to this book several months later. But if you keep going, the payoff is well worth the effort. Give it a hundred pages, and you\u2019ll be hooked. If you like intelligent funny dialogue, clever protagonists facing equally clever antagonists, and vivid original world building, Scott Lynch is your guy. When I got to the end, I immediately ordered the next two books in this series. "}, {"Review": "10.07.18: Kindle offer for 1.99$. I loved this book although it is not perfect and there were some things about it that annoyed me a tiny bit. But well.. love is not a logical thing so...As other reviewers said it is combination of Ocean 11 (with a younger and more cheekier main character) and the Godfather. I would also add the bloodiness of Game of Thrones ((view spoiler)[ and the inclination to kill some of the lovable characters  (hide spoiler)]) and some Jaws.The main character Locke Lamora is an antihero, he has as many flaws as talents and maybe this is why he is so likable. His main quality and doom is his devotion to his friends. I loved the humor, the cursing (a lot of f-words), the characters, the writing, the pace. The fantasy world is described in painstaking detail which was a bit too much for me at some point. The author introduces long descriptions just when the action is at its peak. It made me fast read a couple of them. This was my only problem but I saw that it was exactly what some other reviewers loved about the book. I can't wait to read the sequel. I hope is just as good."}, {"Review": "Upon Reread: 5 starsThe first time I read this book, I wasn't used to fantasy, or the kind of complexities that this story and plot tackles. I'm honestly just in awe of the execution of this story. It's a slow start, and it has some jarring moments as far as the pacing goes, but Scott Lynch did something really unique with the story telling of this book and it's just a brilliant story, with brilliant characters, and I can't wait to continue on in the series.----------------------------------------This is a book that I pushed through because you guys were so excited when I said I would give it a try. I considered putting it down several times because there were several stretches where I felt like nothing would happen. But then the whole world would blow up and I was hooked again.So basically, there were thrilling parts where I was on the edge of my seat and freaking out (or wanting to throw up) and my heart was racing. Then, those unbelievably interesting and dramatic and gruesome scenes would be interrupted but long stretches of backstory. And sometimes the backstory was thrilling too! Sometimes it wasn't. And they came up too much for my taste. I mean, some of the backstory scenes were my favorite scenes in the book! But it felt like we were jumping around too much and it kept disrupting the flow for me.That being said, this book was a masterpiece. It was raw and real and the intricacies and rapid turns were above the skill of most novels I've ever read. How one man could come up with all these scams and tricks and amazing life lessons is beyond me. This book deserves all it's hype. I highly recommend."}, {"Review": "From the first threat to use someone's balls as fish bait to the last attempt to drown someone in horse piss, I absolutely adored this book. It is absolutely everything it should be, and then some. Emphasis on the and then some because it completely defied my expectations on many levels, both genre-wise and quality wise.Set in a freaky, mystical alternate Renaissance Venice, the story takes place amongst the underworld thieves and gangs of the city. Our protagonist (I definitely won't call him a hero), Locke Lamora, and his title implied lies, guide us through a twisted, involved, and incredibly fucking fun (as they would say themselves) plotline that bounces all over the place back and forth and winds to its improbable and yet not unbelievable conclusion. There's thieving, impersonating identities, lots and lots of lies (some well done, others less so), very creative swearing that often made me laugh out loud, gang fights, plenty of gore, and all the intrigue, politics and sweet sweet revenge you could possibly want. And even amongst all this filth and twisted dirtiness, it still manages to be about love and revenge and wonderful, awesome friendship.I loved how this book went right through and around genre expectations. Our protagonist Locke Lamora is not good looking, he isn't at all good in a fight, and we get to watch him be impotent in bed, an arrogant little snit who gets slapped down several times, and taking very very petty, not noble revenge on a bunch of people. He's just really smart. But realistically so. Sometimes even his spectacular ability to lie fails, and he has to go to Plan B. Sometimes Plan C. Sometimes Plan Z, until he's at the end of his tether, before he finally catches a break- and by that point he might be black and blue and humiliated and mutilated in a lot of nasty ways that don't usually get to happen to a hero. They also make no bones about the fact that he is a thief, and not in any Robin Hood sense at all, and no, there is no secret noble quest underneath that. Just deal with it.Scott Lynch is also not afraid to kill people. Nobody is safe in this book, and you geniunely believe that anyone left alive could die on the next page by a random unlucky strike to the back of the head from a penny dropped from a height. He also is not close minded in his plots. He has created an incredible world, and he involves that world in the plot. Sometimes things go awry just... 'cause. Not everyone in the city is part of their plot. Stuff happens. I love that as well. His world creation is absolutely incredible, by the way. No, not by the way. That's a main point. He's meticulous in detail, and yet not boring with it. He spent five pages describing an alien glass garden of roses and I was riveted- I thought it was some of the best pages of the book. He's a skilled storyteller, and his descriptions are just a part of that. He's able to keep things at a very brisk pace and indulge us all the while building his plot and enriching the background.I read this in four days. I give this book four stars just 'cause I'm stingy with the five stars, but it is really a five star book for the fantasy genre, it absolutely is."}, {"Review": "Fantastic book. I loved reading this every bit as much this time as I did the first time. It's fair to say it retains it's place as one of my all time favorite books. This is the story of Locke Lamorra, master thief extraordinaire, and his band of thieves, The Gentlemen Bastards. The Gentlemen Bastards are content with their lot in life and happy to fly under the radar in the city of Camorr. Unfortunately they soon find themselves embroiled in the heart of a power struggle for control of Camorr's criminal underworld. Locke's legendary wits are required to guide his merry band of thieves out of this mess safely. The world Scott lynch creates is fantastically detailed and very unique. The plot is fast paced, complex, and extremely entertaining. I loved the twists and turns, the surprises, and of course the cons pulled by Locke and co. The large cast of brilliant characters made even the sub plots a gripping read. This was at times a dark, gritty, and very brutal tale but that was mitigated by the fantastically humorous banter between the characters, and the very real friendship the Gentleman Bastards clearly shared with each other. Highly recommended to anyone who loves epic fantasy and is not to shocked by bad language!. Audio Note: Michael Page is the narrator here and as always he does a fantastic job. He is extremely good at differentiating between the many different characters voices."}, {"Review": "The Lies of Locke Lamora provoked double-sided feeling in me. The beginning was something long and kinda boring and only the weakening power of conscience and the support of my GR friends made it possible for me to read this book. I just can't and won't write about the difficulties and boredom, I encountered reading the first 200 pages. But there is no possibility to skip the first pages without reading; the story will miss the important, strategic and historical information. So I'll start my review with praises for the remaining part of the book. It was just AWESOME! This book arrived in a perfect storm of buzz, excitement and magic. Scott Lynch definitely charms with a fascinating world, adding a dazzling effect to action and adventure. So the place, ah, the harbor city of Camorr, with shadowed back alleys, complex canals and charming luxury. But when there is wealth, you will definitely find thieves, crime and deception lurking alongside. Locke Lamora and his merry gang of thieves blend in this cauldron and this fascinating story follows them as they arrange their unbelievable frauds. I was amazed of Mr. Lynch's powers to create an outstanding and so alive fantasy world. However I can\u2019t help but wonder what happened to some of the characters, because the information was missing. So it left some gap, which just needs to be filled. Lynch presents the nonlinear story very skillfully, to create humor or tension or just to emphasize the development of the character or some detail. The main character, Locke Lamora, is so charming and he can really claim a place near Glokta in my heart <3. This book tells two tales: the mixed story lines allowed me to see the expanded Locke\u2019s and his friends\u2019 upbringing and training with lot's of danger, adventure and intensity. What really disturbed me is that Locke met his rival only in the third part or the book. Also it was frustrating that there are not much outstanding female characters (and one is even not developed entirely, I mean Sabetha. There were some things mentioned that she is important to Locke, maybe the love of his life and the information about her is so scarce). Of course the twins-fighters and the spider countess Vorchenza play the minor roles, but the main story belongs to men. Also I liked the relationship between Jean and Locke, I read a lot about their childhood lessons and it definitely strengthens their bond. For the most part, this book is a fantastic read and it really promises the adventures of the Gentleman Bastards to be great and entertaining. I found some not tasty things, but the story has many good points, like a well-written and intriguing setting, fantastic imagination of the author, interesting characters and some magic and of course these gems conquer the not tasty things."}, {"Review": "Hello, distinguished review reader. What a nice coincidence stumbling into you here on this expression of thought.Odd chance, you say? Well, I have to be honest with you. I actually planned this for quite a while. I'm playing the long con game with this review.I set up a profile on this site, joined some groups and build a network of friends. And all leads up to today's review.So, I kind of tricked you to lay eyes on these lines of lies.All that I learned from my days with the Gentleman Bastards and their leader, Locke Lamorra. Do you happen to know him?You've probably met him already, but didn't recognize him, cause he was in costume. Maybe he already tricked you into giving him money.He's from the city of Camorr, a beautiful Venice like metropolis, where alchemical lights of all colors are reflected by the famous glass towers in the center of the city.Locke and his friends work their operation from a secret hideout in the bowels of an old temple. But don't bother trying to find it, you would never be able to enter it uninvited.A while back, Locke told me about the Salvara game he and the boys had planned. This would bring in a huge amount of money for the gang, but it wouldn't be the helluva story it is, if all the plans would just work out perfectly. Complications arise everywhere and the Gentleman Bastards are suddenly in all kinds of troubles.What I like about Locke is that, when he tells a story, he tells the whole story. After every part, he illustrates some aspect of the story by giving you a relevant glimpse into his past or Camorr's history. So, long story short, I decided to sign up with the bastards to trick more readers into visting their world.See how they reacted:\"I write reviews, cause my train of thoughts after reading a novel can't stay in the station,\" said Calo.\"Liar!\"\"I write reviews to impress the ladies with my insight and cleverness!\" said Galdo.\"Liar!\"\"I write reviews to get children to read again,\" said Jean.\"Liar!\"\"I write reviews to trick readers into spending money on books,\" said Locke.\"Liar!\"\"I write reviews, cause I want people to hit the Like button,\" I said.\"Bastard!\""}, {"Review": "\n\"Locke Lamora's rule of thumb was this: a good confidence game took three months to plan, three weeks to rehearse, and three seconds to win or lose the victim's trust forever.\"\nOnce upon a time, there was a girl who loved Six of Crows. She cried bitter tears when the duology wrapped up in September, then went on the prowl for something, anything to satisfy the void in her heart.The girl stumbled across Peaky Blinders and for a while, she was happy.But it too began to lose its luster.Scrolling through her to-read list, she found a book she'd previously earmarked as a possible aliment. So, desperate, she dove in. The beginning was confusing and dense, but she pushed on, fortified by her experiences with A Game of Thrones. She was soon rewarded with the clever hijinks of a boy called Locke Lamora. The plot, so cleverly woven, with its layered world-building and interspaced timelines, captivated her. It was not, she realized, a volume one could read whilst occupied with forgetful blue fish. She laughed a great deal reading it.\n\"Master Ibelius, with all due respect, now that I am conscious, if I have to crawl about the city on my hands and knees to do something useful against Capa Raza, I will. I start my war from here.\"He heaved himself up off the sleeping pallet and tried to stand; once again, his head swam, his knees buckled and he toppled to the ground. \"From there?\" said Jean. \"Looks damned uncomfortable.\"\nLike all great books, it tore a irreparable rift in her heart that could only be healed by the mighty hand of deux ex machina and she didn't want that. Locke and Jean's friendship niggled at her until she realized who the pair reminded her of: Albus and Scorpius's \"platonic\" friendship.

I don\u2019t really know what I was expecting when I went into  The Lies of Locke Lamora  But I got an in depth, intricate fantasy world full of morally grey characters and so much backstabbing and double crossing it leaves your head spinning! Locke Lamora is a member of the Gentlemen\u2019s Bastards, a team of thieves who work up detailed plans in order to swindle the rich nobles out of their money. Locke is so good at these schemes and at evading capture, he\u2019s even been given the nickname the \u2018Thorn of Camorr\u2019. We follow Locke as he begins one of his most difficult tricks, all the while numerous other powers are at work. It isn\u2019t long before Locke and his Gentlemen Bastards are caught up in a revenge plot and their lives are on the line. This book doesn\u2019t shy away from both violence and swearing, so be aware if that\u2019s something that would bother you. I enjoyed the similarities it bore to the A Song of Ice and Fire series, but also all the differences that set this book apart. I\u2019m excited to see where the next book takes us!  \u201cJustice is red\u201d "}, {"Review": "what to say that hasn't been said already?nothing! so i'll say it all over again.fun dialogue. great setting\u2014but the author's way more in love with it than i ever got to be, so his endless digressions were frustrating. some of them had a satisfying impact on the story, but some were just random, and frequently set in the past, in a series of irritating interludes right when something exciting was about to happen.some characters wander off, never to be seen again; some are brutally murdered; one is hilariously never seen at all, apparently only existing so nobody thinks locke lamora is a homo. and speaking of women and queers:what's the point of mentioning women if the only ones you care to give any lines are either gruesomely murdered, whores, gruesomely murdered whores, or a\u2014well. maybe that's a teensy bit unfair. the dowager was wildly entertaining. but everyone else? i can think of only one who is not the dowager, invisible, murdered, a whore, or of no real utility whatsoever until someone needs an alchemist at a party.and noooooooo queeeeeeeeeeers.everyone is mediterranean-looking, or blonde as fuck, which\u2014sure, ok, whatever. people have been creating fantasy worlds lacking any sensible distribution of genetic characteristics for hundreds of years, so why stop now?but mostly\u2014mostly\u2014it's the structure that got on my nerves.lynch can write. seriously! the man's got chops. but he chopped his story up, so that every time any dramatic tension or rising capery pleasure developed, it was chop! time for another fucking interlude about the ceremonial vestments of the priesthood of chekthelionassus and why they only wear breechclouts on the third day of grrbhlstnwyrsheddin. no, it's fine\u2014go ahead. i'll wait. it's more fun when you say it out loud anyway.i liked the arc, but would have liked it more if lynch hadn't been messing with it the entire time. for these reasons, and despite a more or less rousing finish only a leeeeetle bit diminished by firstbookitis, i find i can rate this no higher than a two. i thought it was pretty okay\u2014but still just okay."}, {"Review": "The lies of Locke Lamora is a book that the title precisely matches the contents of the book precisely. Because Locke is an amazing and exceptional liar. But this isn't the story of the boy who lied too much, rather the story of the boy who stole too much.\n\u201dIf he had a bloody gash across his throat and a physiker was trying to sew it up, Lamora would steal the needle and thread and die laughing. He\u2026steals too much\u201d\nThat being said, this is a heist book and a book about criminals/thieves. Locke is the best thief I've ever read about. I love how he's theatrical about it. The plot twists and schemes in this book are enough to make a sane man insane. The plot is a mixture of the pat and present with interludes. I found this to be very intriguing. This gave an insight on the back stories of the characters and the past and the present were both interesting enough. \n\u201cNature never deceives us;it is always we who deceive ourselves.\u201d\nWriting;Scott Lynch\u2019s writing is gold. The most unique writing I've ever seen. It's very satire and very full of dark humour.\n\u201dI want that gate swinging wider and faster than a whorehouse door.\u201d\nThe author is a master of stringing words together and making them very authentic.\n\u201dThe pork and capon in his stomach made enthusiastic inquiries about coming up in a nauseous torrent; his throat seemed to be on the verge of granting the request.\u201d\nCharacters\u2606Locke Lamora;A genius. He makes Kaz Brekker look like a child which he is(well kinda) His schemes are bloody schemes. Don't get me wrong, Locke Lamora is not a good guy in anyway. He's more of an anti-hero that\u2019ll always have my support.\u2606Jean Tannen; Loyal friend and the muscle of the group. I love Jean and hid character development very much.\u2606Calo and Galdo; I loved the twins very much but it was hard to tell them apart.\u2606Bug; The youngest in the group. He always said very silly things but i loved him for that.If you love books about criminals and heists then this is the perfect book for you."}, {"Review": "Spoiler-Free Review!\nIt was strange how readily authority could be conjured from nothing but a bit of strutting jackassery.\n Magnificent. Absolutely amazing. I can't express how good this book was. I usually like to take some time after reading a book before I write my review; just to collect my thoughts. Though I feel like my thoughts have been mangled up even more because as time went by my love for this book increased, and thus I may not be able to express how I truly feel. \nSigh\nThis book opens up with our main characters setting up a trap for a scheme to trick this rich man and his wife into giving them money. Simply put, a heist. Easy to understand, right? But then, some-fucking-how, Locke gets himself and his friends into deeper shit. And now you have The Lies of Locke Lamora. At first, while immensely entertaining, this book was quite rough to get through. I'm talking about the first hundred pages, because names of people and places were thrown at me from nowhere, to the point where I felt stupid because I didn't fully grasp everything the characters were talking about. Like I absent-minded-ly missed something while reading or something. But apparently that wasn't the case\u2014thank god\u2014as many people have had the same problem. But boy oh boy, when you start to understand the world; this vivid, real, complex and crazy world; it becomes a literal challenge to put the book down.I'm not going to bluff, though, and say I totally understand this world\u2014I barely understand ours\u2014 but my god, is it fascinating to learn about. I wonder how much time it took Lynch to think this world up and give it life. It's unfathomable. And as for the characters, well, remember the rich man and his wife? Whom Locke wanted to rob? Yeah, I grew to care for these two a lot, like a lot lot, and they are just merely side characters. Side characters whom we're supposed to root against for our main characters. Was that enough to show you how good the characterization is? So if that's the case with side characters, how much do you think I loved our main ones? It's most definitely hard to express in words. We have Locke, the genius. The asshole, and the \"Dad\" of the group. This arrogant little shit who thought of the most crazy ideas ever, who thinks himself impossible to be outsmarted. \n\"The only person who gets away with Locke Lamora games ...\"\"... is Locke ...\"\"... because we think the gods are saving him up for a really big death. Something with knives and hot irons ...\"\"... and fifty thousand cheering spectators.\u201d\nWhen he thinks of a plan, he only pictures himself victorious and nothing more. Losing doesn't cross his mind at all. The bad, deadly and most possible consequences aren't there. And I think that's both an asset and a liability. An asset, where he's confident, sure and determined. But a complete liability when he fucks up and has no back up plan, and then the aftermath is horrible. \n\u201cSomeday, Locke Lamora,\u201d he said, \u201csomeday, you\u2019re going to fuck up so magnificently, so ambitiously, so overwhelmingly that the sky will light up and the moons will spin and the gods themselves will shit comets with glee. And I just hope I\u2019m still around to see it.\u201d\u201cOh please,\u201d said Locke. \u201cIt\u2019ll never happen.\u201d\nGod, I love Father Chains, but do you see what I mean? Though I can't lie to you and say I don't love that about him. I love Locke not only because of his genius but also because of his faults as well. And . . . his love for his \"brothers,\" his partners in crime. They are the only people he cares about and he'd throw away all of his money in the fucking sea to keep them alive and well.Now on the other hand, we have the \"Mom\" of the group. My dear and lovely Jean. He takes care of everyone and has this sort of motherly protectiveness over the rest of the group. So, despite his size and intimidating looks, he's soft and kind. But don't let that fool you, cross the line and you'll meet The Sisters, Jeans deadly weapon. \n\u201cMy name's Jean Tannen, and I'm the ambush.\u201d\nSo although all the characters have a wickedly hilarious sense of humor, we have to have this one\u2014or two in this case\u2014who's just a tad funnier and sillier. Those here are my wonderful Calo and Galdo. And yes, they are twins, which makes it even better somehow. I wouldn't trust them with my life per se, but I would trust them to a thieving or a trickery job any day. We also have Bug, who's the best twelve year-old there ever is, was and will be. Such role-models he has. Locke being his number one, obviously; any twelve year-old would love to have have Locke as a big-brother kind of figure. I know my own little brother would. Okay sarcasm aside, Bug is seriously one of the best\u2014and cutest, if I do say so myself\u2014characters there is. Despite his age, he's as fiery, fierce and brave as ten grown men, if not more. And he deserves the world. And what's best, are the relationships they all have with each other. They have one of the strongest friendship bonds I have ever read about, or even seen in real life. It make me want to cry of how much someone can care for another just like these five do care for each other. I mean, look at this: \n\u201cI only steal because my dear old family needs the money to live!\"Locke Lamora made this proclamation with his wine glass held high; he and the other Gentleman Bastards were seated at the old witchwood table. . . . The others began to jeer.\"Liar!\" they chorused\"I only steal because this wicked world won't let me work an honest trade!\" Calo cried, hoisting his own glass.\"LIAR!\"\"I only steal,\" said Jean, \"because I've temporarily fallen in with bad company.\"\"LIAR!\"At last the ritual came to Bug; the boy raised his glass a bit shakily and yelled, \"I only steal because it's heaps of fucking fun!\"\"BASTARD!\u201d\nMy heart. Honestly, for the plot, just jump in knowing that it's sort of a heist mingled with some gang shit and you'll be satisfied. The plot is clever, and ingeniously spun. It's also intertwined with the best kind of fucking humor there ever is. And trust me, the swearing makes it even better. If you loved either of Six of Crows or The Name of the Wind, I'm sure you'd definitely enjoy this book. What are you waiting for? You're missing out!P.S Thanks so much to Petrik, who helped me decide on which adult fantasy book to read, and recommended this to me. This is one favorite I won't ever forget, and will always have a special place in my heart!"}, {"Review": "this was a wonderful, wonderful experience. it is hard to give a specific rationale for why i loved this book - there are so many reasons! it has adventure, flair, great characters, a robust narrative, a satisfying conclusion, is exceedingly clever and well-written, and just heaps of fun. it is a good-hearted book. terrible things do happen, but the book has at its core a love of humanity, of life, of loyalty, of kindness, of the ways that family can be created, of the ways that children can survive terrible things, of the ways that adults can live with their own kind of honor, even as thieves.strangely enough, there was no romance whatsoever. this was a pleasure to discover! i don't mind romance, when it is done well, but so often it bogs down books that are built on pure narrative - books like this one. no such bogging down occurs.although pretty dark at times, this is also a humorous novel, and i laughed out loud at a lot of the clever moments and at many of the one-liners. maybe not the most subtle use of humor, but i'll take a real laugh when i can get it. as a cynical old man, usually when i laugh out loud at a book, it is in derision.the world-building does not take precedence but it is there, and clearly thought out. i was slightly reminded of both tanith lee's Veniss (Venice by another name) and, strangely, Makkathran from the latest peter hamilton mega-opus. the city really comes alive at certain points. the novel is rich with details of the strangeness of Camorr.the parallels with Ocean's 11 have been made repeatedly, and i suppose it is there. there are also many obvious uses of mafia culture, venice as noted, and italy in general. but put all together, it felt original to me, less derivative and more of a pastiche than a parody. and really, confidence games are timeless.in my misguided excitement after finishing the last page, i started reading reviews on amazon and here in GR. i noticed something very irritating: people complaining about the frequent cursing and dropping of f-bombs. okay, now i can understand this if you are normally a fan of Regency romance or, say, classic adventure along the lines of rafael sabatini. or less violent fantasy in general. then i can understand the complaints and even respect them. but if you are a fan of rowdy modern adventure & fantasy, genres that frequently include blood & guts & murder & mutilation & slaughter....THEN GET A FUCKING GRIP ALREADY AND GET YOUR FUCKING PRIORITIES IN ORDER! my gosh, reading that kind of almost insanely unbalanced perspective really gets me agitated - you can read about humans being bloodily killed or tortured and yet the word FUCK gets your panties in a bunch? in a novel that depicts a city that hangs child thieves in public, it is swear words that really bother you?i hate to end a review of a book i loved on such a negative note, but i had to get that off of my chest. so i'll end the review like this: if you like adventure, read this book! it's awesome."}], "Image": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1458646334l/29588376.jpg", "Desc": "An orphan\u2019s life is harsh\u2014and often short\u2014in the mysterious island city of Camorr.
