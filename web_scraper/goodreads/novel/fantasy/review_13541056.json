Ghosts of the Shadow Market 8/10\n\n\u201cThere was blood on the Council dais, blood on the steps, blood on the walls and the floor and the shattered remnants of the Mortal Sword.\u201d\n\nFriends, it has been a ride. I have spent the last six months reading everything that Cassie Clare has created for the Shadowhunter world, and it was all leading up to this moment \u2013 the release of Queen of Air and Darkness. And friends, it was so worth it. Not only was reading all of these books and stories, and falling in love with so many of these characters and worlds, a highlight in my reading year, it was just a highlight in my 2018. And I just want to thank each and every single one of you that came along with me on this journey. \n\n\u201cBlood always matters, to the wrong sort of people\u201d\n\nAnd this book picks up immediately after the events in LoS. Fascists are trying to control the Clave and dictate how Downworlders should be treated. In Faerie, the Seelie and the Unseelie court are trying to hurt each other, while the Unseelie King has something that the Seelie Queen doesn\u2019t want to live without. Warlocks are hurting, so many of our main cast of characters are missing, and so many people are grieving the loss of loved ones. \n\n\u201cSympathy is common. Knowing the exact shape of the hole someone\u2019s loss leaves in your heart is rare.\u201d\n\nQueen of Air and Darkness is truly a love letter to grief. The first section of this review is going to be spoiler free, so I\u2019m going to try to be really vague. Ty is choosing to ignore his grief, Alec is throwing himself into work and wanting a better world because of his grief, Julian thinks revenge is the only way to work through his grief, Emma has finally made headway with her past grief, to only be forced to experience more all over again. We see parents grieving the loss of their children, children grieving the loss of their parents, and everyone grieving the loss of loved ones because of wars they didn\u2019t ask to be a part of. But that\u2019s what happens when you love people, and you let them in, because nothing is permanent, and grief is inevitable. There is no wrong way to grieve, but you do get to choose the actions you perform in the name of that grief. And we get to see people make a lot of hateful choices, and take a lot of hateful actions, because of their grief; Cohorts and fae queens and kings alike.And this third and final installment in The Dark Artifices series does get rather dark, so please use caution. Content and trigger warnings for hate speech (always challenged and always negative), threatening to out someone, talk of wanting to sexually assault someone, self-harm, death, loss of a loved one, murder, torture, captivity, blood depictions, strong depictions of grief, trauma, and depression, talk of suicide, a lot of violence, and war themes. As always, Cassie is so very inclusionary and gives us so much rep that is very respectively done. From so much sexuality and gender representation, to racial diversity, to giving us a main character on the autism spectrum, to body diversity, to really respecting mental health in this book. I\u2019m not saying that Cassie Clare is the pinnacle of what representation in books should be, but I\u2019ll be dammed if she isn\u2019t trying, and if she isn\u2019t doing a better job than any other cis white woman writing YA currently. Overall, it is also actually wild how talented Cassandra Clare is, because the cast of her books are so large and expansive, but I\u2019d die for almost every single one of them. I had so much fun reading this last installment, even if it wasn\u2019t my favorite. But I will talk more about that below! I will say that I need The Red Scrolls of Magic, The Last Hours, & The Wicked Powers right this very second. Like, the wait is probably going to kill me. But I\u2019m going to die with the biggest smile on my face. Please use caution reading the rest of this review if you have not read this book and all the series leading up to this book! And as always, I\u2019m going to do a little mini character breakdown on my thoughts and feelings on all the main characters in this book. Spoilers ahead!(Art by Alice Duke!)\u27bd Emma Carstairs - You all, I can\u2019t even talk about Emma properly. She is my favorite Shadowhunter of them all. I love her, I love her bravery, I love her empathy, and I love how she loves. I\u2019ll be honest, the worst part about turning the last page of this book is knowing that I\u2019ll never be able to read another new book where she is the main character. \u27bd Julian Blackthorn - First off, Madalyn pointing out that Julian is probably demisexual added ten years to my life and I needed you all to know this. Next, Julian Blackthorn is my everything and I hate that I\u2019m so weak for this soft boy, but it is the damn truth. Also, because I\u2019m a perv and this needs to be said, Julian and Emma reciting the parabatai vow while fucking? My kink. My fucking kink. Damn. The gifts CC gives us. \u27bd Church - The real MVP of this book. \u27bd Helen Blackthorn-Penhallow - Helen and Aline are going to be the best moms ever, and I am so happy that Cassie finally let us see this power couple! And I can\u2019t wait to actually see them fall in love during TRSoM, but I know it is going to be my favorite thing in this entire series! \u27bd Aline Blackthorn-Penhallow - Okay, Helen and Aline are my TRUE OTP! And Aline literally give me life, while standing up for Helen, during this entire 900+ page story. And I\u2019m here for any story that is a bout an Asian girl getting into a sapphic relationship with a fae girl. I mean, it is kind of my life goal. \u27bd Mark Blackthorn - You all, we did it, and CC answered our prayers! And she gave us the polyamorous relationship of my dreams! I will say that I don\u2019t entirely love that they only have their cabin to share their love, but I hope that a lot happens in future books to make this trio able to truly spend all of their lives with one another. But that scene on the boulder between the three of them? 11/10, I will be rereading once a week for the rest of my life. \n\n\u201cAll this time we were waiting for you. We loved each other, and it was a great thing, but with you, it is even greater.\u201d\n\n\u27bd Cristina Rosales - I just love Cristina. I love her friendship with Emma, but I loved her deciding, at her own pace, what she wanted in her life. And she\u2019s so damn strong, while being so damn giving, and she honestly deserves the entire world. Also, no offense, but Cassie Clare also gave her the worst Shadowhunter weapons, imo. \u27bd Kieran - I mean, you all know I\u2019m trash for dark (ever changing) haired fae princes who end up being king. But like, I\u2019d love Kieran even if he was none of those things. He is honestly probably my third favorite character in all of the Shadowhunter world. And when all the fae people were remembering all the kind things he did for them, and when the little girl gave him the white flower? Friends, I\u2019m weak, and soft, and crying, and in love with Kieran so very much. \u27bd Adaon - Wow, the resident sleeper and true hero of this story. \u27bd Kit Rook / Christopher Herondale - Alright, Kit is going to have the coolest power(s) in the Shadowhunter world. But I truly loved how this book officially proved that Kit is going to have an actual claim to rule all of Faerie, and I\u2019m here for it. \u27bd Tiberius Blackthorn - Oh Ty, my sweet Ty. You know this necromancy and dark magic are going to follow him all the way through TWP! You all also know that I\u2019m a sucker for siblings who are best friends, and Thule Livvy\u2019s letter actually gutted me. \n\n\u201cI love you. I love you. I love you.\u201d\n\n\u27bd Livvy Blackthorn - I don\u2019t really understand how ghost Livvy works, or how the connection with Ty works, but it equally breaks and warms my heart. But I do really wish she would have just been able to rest in peace.\u27bd Octavian Blackthorn - I feel like Poor Tavvy is the character that is looked over, but it is because he is still so little. But I cried really hard when he told Julian that he just wanted to go home at the end. Julian really raised all these kids to be brave, to be strong, and to love always. \u27bd Dru Blackthorn - Dru truly has grown up and came into her own during these three books. I love her, and I loved seeing her journey. And I especially loved seeing Ty spend more time with her. I can\u2019t wait to see her grow and shine even more in TWP where she will be a main character. \u27bd Ash - Did Cassie really have to give him Rhysand wings? Truly? Honestly? Lord, why? But\u2026 I\u2019m here for it, and I also ship him and Drusilla so damn hard already. When he picked up that picture that Julian drew and learned her name? I screamed. I can\u2019t wait for that to make another appearance. \u27bd Magnus Bane - You all know Magnus is my favorite. Every book I fall more and more in love with him. And seeing him as a dad? It is truly the best. Also, Magnus having a heart to heart with Ty about gutted me, because it was so damn beautiful. \u27bd Alec Lightwood - I honestly feel like Alec was a real shining star in this book. And he is going to completely change the world with unconditional love. And seeing him become Consul of the Clave? I don\u2019t even have words. Alec started out as a character that was hard for me to like, now he\u2019s a character that\u2019s hard for me not to love. \n\n\u201cNo shining new world could be built on blood and bones.\u201d\n\n\u27bd Zara Dearborn - Worst part of this book? That Zara didn\u2019t die. And now she has her own little private city to breed her hate. I am so not looking forward to what is going to come of her and her hateful gang being left alone. Real talk, I would have been like, \u201cWe will leave all you Cohorts alone, as long as you give us her!\u201d *winky face* I\u2019m a petty and bitter bitch. \u27bd Horace Dearborn - Thank you, next. \u27bd The Kelpie (that Julian saved) - I always love the magical creatures of stories, that come and help and save that day. But this was too damn much for me. TOO DAMN MUCH. \u27bd Manuel Casales - This guy is so chaotic evil. And I\u2019m so bitter that he didn\u2019t die while Emma and Julian were on their wild rampage. \u27bd Diego Rosales - I also really couldn\u2019t ever truly like Diego. Yeah, he did Kieran a solid, and I respect it, but I still never really liked him. He is one of the few side characters I\u2019m okay saying goodbye to. \u27bd Jaime Rosales - I feel like CC is just going to give Dru all the options between Ash, Cameron, and Jaime, but Jaime is the one that skeezes me out for some reason. I just, don\u2019t want it to happen. Nice dagger gift and all, boy no. \u27bd Diana Wrayburn - I will say that I was a little uncomfortable with how Julian and Emma found out about Diana being trans, but I am honestly just so happy that she is living her best life now, while being able to be open. And the talk she has with Julian and Emma, when she is like, \u201cNo, I\u2019ve always been a woman.\u201d Praise/bless. Give me an entire Diana series, please, Cassie Clare. \u27bd Gwyn - Wow, the best character in the entire Shadowhunter universe. The blessings. \u27bd Catarina Loss - Catarina is the best side character, and she does so much good, and she is so pure, and I wept extra hard when she stood by Magnus at his wedding. Like, these warlocks put me in my feels every single time. \u27bd Ragnor Fell / Shade - And this warlock just makes me laugh so damn hard. And I cheered out loud when the reveal actually came to fruition! I can\u2019t wait to see even more of him with Ty in Scholomance. \u27bd Annabel Blackthorn - What a missed opportunity in this book to not give Annabel a better story. I\u2019ll talk more about this below, but Annabel deserved better, especially with how breathtaking this cover it.\u27bd The (old) Unseelie King - I don\u2019t know if I just forgot, or if I never picked up on it, but this dude had a half skeletal, half handsome face? That\u2019s actually badass. \u27bd The Seelie Queen - This bitch. She legit just shows up in every book, in every timeline, just to rain on everyone\u2019s parade. \u27bd Tessa & Jem - I screamed all over again after they announced they were pregnant. And now that they are going to raise a Herondale, Kit, so he can be safe? Ah, I just love this little family so much.\u27bd Izzy & Simon - I really wish they played bigger roles in this story, and that we would have received two weddings in this 900+ page tome!\u27bd Clary Fairchild - I won\u2019t lie, I was really disappointed when we found out what Clary\u2019s vision really was. God, I mean, I knew Cassie wouldn\u2019t actually kill her, but I wanted to so much more, and it was a really anticlimactic reasoning. \u27bd Jace Herondale - \u201cI would die for Jace to shoot finger guns at me\u201d - Lea, 2018. Real talk, Jace had me actually laughing out loud during this entire book and I loved and hated every single second of it. Especially his banter with Kit, I mean, Christopher. And when Jace voted in Alec for Consul of the Clave? The tears just won\u2019t stop, friends. \u27bd Evil Jace Herondale - Lord, why do you want us to suffer? \n\n\u201cThere is nothing simple about vengeance, and nothing pure\u201d\n\nOkay, so one element or \u201ctrope\u201d that I hate when books do is that alternate and/or parallel universe storyline. And I never, in a million years, would have guessed that Cassie Clare would pull this in QoAaD, but here we are. I\u2019ll be honest, I kind of loved the concept of a Mad Max world where Sebastian Morgenstern not only won the Dark War, but now rules, but the entirety of Part Two was a little too much for me. Especially because they didn\u2019t even bring back Thule Livvy and Thule Raphael. And in return, it almost felt like tragedy porn seeing them live again. And now we have an evil Jace in our world and on the loose to\u2026 kill Clary? Love Clary? To do something with Clary? Yikes. But the true reason I am giving this book four stars, and the reason I probably think it is the weakest book in The Dark Artifices is because of Annabel. What a missed opportunity to have an amazing villain character. Instead, she dies at 60%, only for us to be rickrolled with a demon pretending to be her. She died so easily, too, and it felt so bad. I mean, she is on the cover of this book! And the title is completely her! Why would she barely show up in the 900+ pages, have the lamest death, and have no character development when she could have been such an amazing and intricate character. \n\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t leave me in this world without you.\u201d\n\nAnd then let\u2019s not forget about Julian and Emma turning into giant, angel versions of King Kong, picking up and yeeting the bad guys. Even though, Zara conveniently didn\u2019t get yeeted. Like, for a second I actually thought Emma was going to die, and then, in turn, Julian would have died, too. But when Emma said, \u201cLet us burn.\u201d I thought they would just die and become angels together, and my emo and sappy ass would have loved that. But instead, the whole wild giant thing happened, and then words of their loved ones \u201chealed\u201d them. Which was eyeroll worthy, but also sweet. Yet, when the heavenly fire didn\u2019t damage ANYTHING except their parabatai bond? You all, I can\u2019t. It just feels so unsatisfying. And Emma and Julian really are my favorite couple in all things Shadowhunter, but even I can\u2019t just accept that and pretend it was realistic. I honestly think CC just wrote herself into a hole, and putting a bright and shiny bow on it was the only option, but it doesn\u2019t mean I have to like it. I will also say that the ending was completely and utterly fanservice, but it was fanservice that I ate up with a spoon and asked for more. Magnus and Alec\u2019s wedding was everything, and Alec\u2019s proposal made me actually ugly cry. Just seeing everything that these two have been through, all the lives they\u2019ve impacted, all the family they have made, they were just so damn deserving of this happiness. And then the short story after the epilogue? With Jace and Clary in that greenhouse? God, that greenhouse. It really feels so full circle, doesn\u2019t it? All of these original characters have brought me so much happiness in 2018, and seeing them get moments of pure happiness at the end of this book was honestly everything. \n\n\u201cAs long as you exist and I exist, I will love you.\u201d\n\nOverall, I\u2019d give my life for Emma Carstairs and any of the Blackthorns and I will never forget this reading experience. Picking up City of Bones this year was one of the best decisions I\u2019ve ever made. And now I finally get to wait and suffer for the next thing Cassie Clare publishes with the rest of you! And special thank you to Lea, Sol, Madalyn, Jane, & Amber for allowing me to cry and scream and gush with you! You all made the experience even more special and I love you all! \u2764Blog | Instagram | Twitter | Tumblr | Youtube | Twitch"}, {"Review": "The inside dust jacket!!! This is one of the most beautiful covers! Well shit! This book had all the feels in the world!! Sadnesssssss, happiness, anger - ALL OF THEM! I'm happy with this ending. That epilogue! You know what? I said I wasn't going to read any more books she writes in this series because I'm done. But after all of that, I might read the other books coming out to see what else is going to happen. Always makes me nervous with my favorite authors out there because I'm afraid they are going to kill too many of my loves. There are actually books I haven't continued because I know a love is going to die. Guess it's time to buckle up buttercup and read ALL THE BOOKS! Peace, love and apple pie! Mel \ud83d\udda4\ud83d\udc36\ud83d\udc3a\ud83d\udc3e\ud83d\ude18\ud83e\udd84\ud83d\udc95"}, {"Review": "this truly WAS the infinity war of the shadowhunter chronicles, it was so wild to see so many characters from across this universe play a role here and I LOVED IT.I've had like a month to process this book and okay like I don't think my brain and heart will EVER be able to process what this book just did to me but I'm going to try. So, yes below you can read my \nFULL REVIEW OF QUEEN OF AIR AND DARKNESS\n (also, I'm saying now I CANNOT PROMISE THIS REVIEW WILL BE SPOILER FREE OK YOU WERE WARNED)\n\u201cThe sky was a road and the stars made pathways; the moon was a watchtower, a lighthouse that led you home.\u201d\nThis book was easily my most anticipated book of the year. I had made a big claim that if Queen lived up to Clockwork Princess, then The Dark Artifices would become my new favourite series of Cassandra Clare's. I don't know how I feel about that now. This ending wasn't as good as the Clockwork Princess ending for me, but there was SO many things I loved about it. I loved the characters, (most) of the plot, the angst, the romance, and seeing all the different series come together (most of the time). But there was some things (the lst 100 pages) that annoyed me so I just couldn't give it a five star even though it SHOULD HAVE BEEN ..... it COULD HAVE BEEN ....... im furious ! Anyways, lets break this bad bitch down: \n\u201cI whisper your name, Ty. I whisper the most important thing: I love you. I love you. I love you.Livvy\u201d \n\nCHARACTERS\nLets start with characters because it's my favourite part of this seriesEmma remains my favourite character, what an iconic queen. I honestly ADORE Emma and she's one of my favourite CC characters ever. She's changed and developed so much between book one and three, but I love what a strong badass she is whilst also being caring and compassionate and maintaining important relationships. It's nice to have a female character who'd badass and blunt but not necessarily cold. I literally love her, and I really want her to punch me in the face because it'd be an HONOUR. Julian for some reason a lot of people don't like Julian but I LOVE JULIAN. He's such an interesting and unusual main male character, especially from Cassandra Clare. So I think he adds a really great dimension to this series and is such a contrast to characters like Will or Jace. AND ANTI-HERO JULIAN FINALLY KINDA ROSE AND I WAS SCARED. All in all I loved his arc in this book .. the dark julian contrasted with actual julian was painful to read but I loved it. YOU ARE IN THE CAGE? I cried. Also, I just love Dad! Julian and how he treats his entire family dfjghdfkj. ALSO WE LOVE A DEMISEXUAL !! KING!!!!!Mark, Cristina and Kieran SO I have always felt meh about Mark. I don't dislike him .. I actually like him quite a bit. I just don't like him as much as some people seem to. I felt pretty much the same about him in this as I always have. I love Cristina and I loved her in this too. But I felt she didn't get as good an arc as the other characters? Her entire plot was pretty much romance which was kind of annoying though I DID LOVE HER TEAM UP IN FAERIE. ICONIC!! Kieran I still feel mixed on. I've never liked him much but he did grow on me a bit in this. I actually kinda ended up liking him even though I still don't care about him on the same level as the other characters. But his character arc was great. Kit and Ty THEY WERE NOT IN THIS ENOUGH?? Okay yes they literally had a major plot arc BUT STILL. Ty should of have a POV but he never did! I also hated the conclusion of their arc ... obviously it's going to be the main focus of The Wicked Powers but it was SO unsatisfying here. I also though Ty's literally had no growth in the 700 pages of this book which was annoying. But I LOVED KIT SO MUCH. Thats my son !!!! I really liked his role in this book and his POVs were some of my favourite. He is fucking iconic and hilarious .. \"you are so forked\", bitch you better BET i laughedDru My unexpected fave of this book. In Lord of Shadows I liked Dru but felt I didn't really know her. She had SO much development and growth in this and I loved her role. I didn't expect to love her so much but I seriously do, and I think of all the characters I am MOST excited to see more of DRU in The Wicked Powers! She stole my heart, I love her. Jaimie and Diego They were in this more than I expected and I didn't .. love it. Honestly I did Not like Diego's chapters much, I just don't care about them that much so their chapters were always the ones that made me want to put this book down. But I did like their characters in relation to their character arc with Cristina.Diana  I LOVE DIANA and I honestly don't have heaps more to say about her?? I liked how she became a more important role in the Clave in this book and I also liked how there was more focus on her being an older sister to Emma and Julian in this. Helen and Aline  MY SAPPHIC QUEEEENS ! I love both of them so much. Aline was such a fun character because she was so different to Helen and even to Jules and Emma in terms of how she handled the kids. Helen was sweet and I LOVED her relationship with Mark in this. Seeing those two interact were some of my favourite parts of this book. Aline and Helen are also so fucking cute jghfkgj it's unfair of Ms Clare to show us gays a pair of gfs that cute when she KNOWS none of us can achieve that irl because all gays are too useless to actually date other gays. \n\u201cGrief can be so bad you can\u2019t breathe, but that\u2019s what it means to be human. We lose, we suffer, but we have to keep breathing.\u201d \n\nPLOT\nQueen of Air and Darkness picks up right where Lord of Shadows ends. I loved this choice but also I WAS IN SO MUCH PAIN. The scenes of Julian crying and Ty passing out were hard to read and seriously I was emotionally wrecked by page 25 I literally had to take a break. I pretty thoroughly enjoyed the first third of this book. The chapters in faerie were exciting and I liked seeing so many different characters play a role. Simon, Isabelle, Jace, Clary and more appearing was so fun and I loved the cameos. The plot in faerie reminded me a lot of Lord of Shadows but I decided I didn't mind it. That fight in the throne room also reminded me of that fight scene in The Last Jedi with Kylo/Rey and bitch I was HOLLERING. The only plot in the first third I wasn't a fan of was Julian's emotions things - I didn't think it was bad but it just came out of nowhere? In no previous books, even when Emma and Julian discuss their \"options\" did him removing his emotions come up so it felt out of nowhere and kind of lazy? The second part in Thule was literally my favourite part of the book which seems to be an unpopular opinion, but I thought it was SO MUCH FUN. It was like a canon AU and I was loving it. Seeing the world as it would have been was interesting, and I loved Emma and Julian's arc in this. The focus on their romance and Julian's choices was great and Thule really allowed a lot of emotional catharsis and tangible contrast between what is and what could have been. ALSO JULIAN AND EMMA FUCKING WHILST SAYING THEIR PARABATAI VOWS WAS HOT AND LITERALLY IS MY KINKThe final section was my least favourite and where everything seemed to fall apart. I felt Cassandra Clare had so many thread and plots and character things to work with and they ended up not coming together great. It definitely felt like she lost control of the story a bit. The climax was .. incredibly disappointing and so cliche. Again, the whole \"Nephilim Parabatai\" thing just came literally out of nowhere. The ending of Julian and Emma's complications with being Parabatai was so lazy and wasn't even foreshadowed as a legitimate option until it randomly happened. Using heavenly fire again also felt lazy and the whole \"family talks you down\" thing was SO cliche. I felt so unsatisfied with the ending here, and I really just can't get over Emma and Julian randomly going giant, throwing around the evil elf army like what the FUCK even was that. It was just messy and weird. \n\u201cBe good, my archer boy. Come back to me.\u201d \n\nROMANCE & ANGST\nSo where the plot let me down, the angst came THROUGH. Honestly I was going into this wanting some sweet, sweet, painful angst and phew, once again the good sis Cassandra delivered. JULIAN AND EMMA .... *kisses fingers* oh yeah thats the STUFF. Like I've said multiple times, I adore them. ADORE THEM. I honestly love their friendship/relationship so much and the whole set up of them being best friend, literally Being Eachother's People, like no one loves them as much as they love eachother ... oh fuck YES thats the shit. I THRIVE off of that. And she delivered in spades .. she really did. AND OH THE ANGST OF DARK! JULIAN. And Dark! Julian being like lowkey hot ... yeah I'm into that. Anyway, truly excellence once again. Mark, Cristina and Kieran ... FINALLY the OT3 we all love and deserve. I see you boring bitches whining about the ending of this love triangle but it is WHAT. WE. DESERVE. Turning your love triangle into a polyam ship? inspired. And it honestly was so well written? That they're all equally in love with eachother?? That Mark/Cristina or Mark/Kieran or Kieran/Cristina doesnt even work because they're all thinking about one another like .. it's mess and I adore it? And the three way ship is perfect?? BUT THE ENDIGN .... I hate that omg ! It was so unresolved which was annoying as fuck but also I stan King Kieran so idk phew that is a tough one. I feel it will also be resolved in The Wicked Powers (IM HOPING)Ty and Kit ... they're so cute aw man. I love Kit's inner monologue around Ty, he's so enamoured with him in such a pure and cute way and there is definitely going to be an arc around him Realising He Is Queer which should be fun. He really is the bi king I deserved. And Ty always recruiting Kit and trusting Kit was so sweet, they're both sweet and even tho I'm an angst DEMON I was rooting for them and their softness. Jace and Clary. LOOK ALL I AM GOING TO SAY IS THEM GOING BACK TO THE GREENHOUSE TO WHERE IT ALL STARTED HAD ME EMO AND ALSO THEM BOTH BUYING A RING ....... INSPIRED\n\u201cYou might be in the cage, Jules, but as long as you are like this, I am in the cage with you.\u201d\n\nISSUES\nAlright the gush has been real now it's time to do some quick rants x Although I loved the Thule chapters, I had one huge issue and that is MAKING SEBASTIAN THE VILLAIN. Sebastian is the one behind all this nonsense and I HATE THAT. It is SO lazy to just bring an old dead villain back, and it's fucking annoying. What is the point of TMI and killing Sebastian if random alternate universe Sebastian can just return to fuck it up? I thought that was so lazy, and completely the opposite of what I had come to expect from CC in this trilogy. In Lady Midnight, Malcolm being the villain completely subverted my expectations because she kept setting up warlock = good, and then she undermined it, which was neat. Malcolm was also such a strong villain with interesting and complex motivations. And while I love Sebastian as a villain, he doesn't fit here, and he's just pure evil, which is fun in tmi but ultimately boring to repeat over and over. I felt CC really let down the great start to the series and intricate plot she had set up. I also was ... so sick of the cameos. Does anyone else wish she would just let TMI go?? At first they were fun, but they started to totally eclipse the other, main characters. I don't want a continuation of their plots, I want the Blackthorns story! LET THEM GOOOO. Also, the epilogue totally sets up The Wicked Powers as City of Lost Souls 2.0 and i am ... not keen. And like I said the last 100 pages were just .. messy. I'm annoyed because I SHOULD have given this a five star .. it was going so well. Everything I came for was there. The angst was top notch, the character interactions were great, and the book was fast paced and exciting. But those last 100 pages were too much and just so cliche and weird. And the ending was complete fanservice, which usually I don't mind, but this was WAY too much. I've said this soo many times but I HATE when books with dramatic \"this is going to change everything this is the end of the world\" plots have literally no consequences. Like the tagline of this book was literally \"everything changes\" but in the end nothing happened and everyone got to be happy. LOOK I LOVE PAIN AND SUFFERING OKAY. But I just think it's a super let down and doesn't deliver on my expectations of something Big happening.Okay, I admit the loss of Idris was big and will probably play a big role in the next book .. but again it's the same problem I have with other plot lines. Nothing was finished off in this series ! It was all left for the next one. Which is lazy and unsatisfying. I get her series run on to eachother, but the ending of each individual series should still be satisfying and contained to that series in my opinion. \n\u201cIf aught but death part thee and me, Emma,\u201d he said, and pressed his lips to the strands. Emma closed her eyes as she whispered, \u201cJulian. Julian. If aught but death part thee and me.\u201d \nAlright .. that is IT! This is an extremely gushy and messy review I recognise and own it. You'll just have to live with it. PLEASE chime off in the comments I still need to discuss this book I am still in shock"}, {"Review": "This was a wild ride (and a really LONG one).

Generally, this just felt very thrown together in comparison to the fairly well-balanced nature of earlier books. Let\u2019s talk some details.First of all, the concept of Thule\u2026 is good. [And Melanie\u2019s description of it as a Mad Max version of the Shadowhunters world is honestly real.] BUT it takes up about a quarter of this 900 (nine hundred) page book, and it. has. no. bearing. on the plot. until the epilogue. in which it is used to set up another whole ass trilogy.Also, what the fuck happened with Anabelle? Anabelle honestly has one of the better villain setups Cassie has ever pulled off, and the fact that she does nothing except die, and dies halfway through the book is just. It\u2019s just a mess. I hate it. Just as in\u2026 every one of CC\u2019s conclusions I\u2019ve read, I think the first five chapters or so should have been incorporated into the last book. She has a tendency to set up The Final Showdown conflicts at the beginning of the third book rather than at the end of the second, which messes with her flow, leaving us with abrupt book two endings (Lord of Shadows. i loved that book but admit it, this is a problem) and lacking buildup for events in book three.Here is a simple way this couldve been done to this particular book: end it not on the note of (view spoiler)[Livia\u2019s death (hide spoiler)], but on the note of Julian\u2019s trip to see Magnus. This both makes the ending of book two less abrupt and, more importantly, given how weirdly disconnected some of this conflict feels, sets up an approximate book three conflict. Oh, and speaking of villains, remember how Zara was going to die and I was going to be allYeah. I don\u2019t either. \n\n\u27bdF A N S E R V I C E I N P S\n\nRemember back in my review of book one, when Jace and Clary\u2019s heavyhanded but brief cameo was the most I\u2019ve liked them in the entire canon of the universe, and yes it was fanservice but it was fun? Oh man. Good old days. This could have been The Mortal Instruments book #7, City of I Don\u2019t Give A Shit for all the TMI presence. I don\u2019t even know if I\u2019m referring to stuff with earlier characters, because I actually don\u2019t mind that too much. Magnus and Alec, two of the only characters in TMI I actually like, have stopped being done dirty finally; Jem and Tessa are two of my favorite fictional characters and I can\u2019t even pretend to complain about their cameo; even though I never got to their minor presence in TMI part two, Helen and Aline are amazing. So maybe it\u2019s not even about the fanservice; it\u2019s just that the. scope. is. so. so. wide. By this, I am of course referring to: Thule, and the return of Sebastian Morgenstern and his secret?? son?? a character I will not even pretend to give a shit about. And also Emo Jace. And okay, listen, I know Cassandra Clare isn\u2019t exactly trying to get all of her work done completely sans-fanservice: the investment in the characters and relationships is the backbone of her work, what makes it so easy to enjoy. But unlike some of her other books, this just\u2026 fell flat? It feels like the heart, the enthusiasm, the genuine love that she poured into The Infernal Devices and earlier books in this series was just... missing.\n\n\u27bdT H E A C T U A L E N D I N G\n\nUh, so first of all, I will say that I didn\u2019t totally 100% hate the actual ending. I just didn't really feel it was built up enough. And to me, it demonstrated just how little progress was made within this book.Here's the thing: of the three main character dynamics used for conflict within this series \u2014 Christina & Kieran & Mark, Kit & Ty, and Julian & Emma \u2014 only one is genuinely resolved. And the thing is, this lack of resolution sort of works; one dynamic is about half-resolved and just dealing with problems, and one is not even close to being resolved but they're getting a whole series written about them, so fine. But I think my overwhelming feeling upon first finishing this book was... wow, is that all we're resolving? Is that all the progress we've made? Really, in 900 pages? In that case... couldn't it have just been 500 pages?Moving on. The final battle is... sort of cool, but it is awkwardly written, and feels fairly contrived. We know something magic is going to happen at the end, and we hope it'll lead to a somewhat decent ending, but the buildup falls apart just a little on the way. On that topic: (view spoiler)[no one dying. See, I actually hate major character death, so I can\u2019t really pretend to be upset about this, but no one really gets changed permanently by the battle, either? (hide spoiler)] To me, it just feels like this series has been pretending the ending is going to make us all sooooo sad, and it doesn't. It's a series about hope and coming together, which is great \u2014 it just shouldn't be talked about as a tragic romance, that's all. \n\n\u27bdI S W E A R, I D I D N\u2019 T H A T E I T\n\nUm\u2026 I thought the first 20% or so of this book was really pretty solid? This section was also a lot funnier! Examples of this phenomenon include: \u27bd\u201cand- julian is like sebastian morgenstern!\u201d *cue Diego laughing really hard*Julian putting his boots on Horace\u2019s desk like a legend\u27bd\u201cyou two have really fucked up.\u201d \u27bd\u201cever wanted to move objects with your mind?\u201d \u201csure, sounds great!\u201d \u27bd\u201cwho hates you? I\u2019ll kill them!\u201d which is just a deeply Aline thing to sayI\u2019ve sort of alluded to this already, but the most coherent main theme of this book is the idea of grieving for the lost being a necessary process, and when that theme stands out amongst the generally muddled plot, it\u2019s handled well. Julian\u2019s arc around grief is nuanced and fairly well-handled; Emma\u2019s arc has sort of always been about grief, it\u2019s just that this book realizes it better than earlier books. Ty\u2019s arc around grief is honestly just kind of heartbreaking. Kieran\u2019s arc focuses more around finding forgiveness, but it feels coherent with the rest of the arcs. Alec\u2019s arc (I know) is around worrying about eventual grief and is\u2026 honestly better than any character arc he got in TMI? SORRY. For those of you in the comments saying I\u2019m rating generously\u2026 I mean, I guess I am. But I can\u2019t actually give this book two stars because, as I deepdived into in previous reviews (#shamelessselfpromo), I like these characters way too much. OH AND. You all know I\u2019ve been talking about this nonstop, but Mark and Christina and Kieran!! Being a canon dynamic!! I really really wanted more out of their buildup, to be honest, because it\u2019s been utterly fantastic up to this book, but I\u2019m just. So so happy. That the polyamorous trio is canon. I\u2019ve been waiting six months but the rest of you have all been waiting years so round of applause for that!!I also think, removing all critique, that juggling ten to fifteen lead characters with any degree of success is incredibly difficult, and the fact that this is even somewhat pulled off is really impressive. I mean, even putting important-in-the-future characters like Dru (who deserved more airtime), Tavvy, Dark Livvy, Gwyn (codename the only man i trust), Cameron, Jaime (who i dislike. just facts), Diego (who i now love!!), and Ash (??) to the side, and even eliminating villains like Zara, Manuel, Horace, the Seelie Queen, the Unseelie King, Annabel, Sebastian, and Dark Jace, and even not counting the massive presence of TMI characters like Helen, Aline, Jace, Clary, Magnus, Alec, and Ragnor Fel \u2014 several of whom have actual character arcs in this book \u2014 we still have Julian and Emma, Mark and Christina and Kieran, Kit and Ty, and Diana starring as genuine leading characters. That\u2019s a total of thirty-one names including eight leads. Impressive as fuck. \n\n\u27bdE N D I N G T H O U G H T S\n\nNo one has ever accused me of being coherent. \u2192this series could also be called Julian Makes A Bad Decision: News at 11\u2192Everything Diana And Gwyn Have Ever Done. It\u2019s Flawless And Good\u2192There was a line in this book in which Aline\u2019s posture is described as \u201cstraight,\u201d which is something no self-respecting gay would write without making a joke. That\u2019s not a flaw. I just think I\u2019m funnier than I actually am.Anyway. Yes, as we\u2019ve discussed, the entire existence of this whole world is kind of ridiculous, but I\u2019m not going to pretend I don\u2019t love it. \nlooking out for:\nThe Red Scrolls of Magic | 2 April 2019Chain of Gold | 19 November 2019The Wicked Powers | sometime, 2022\ndark artifices reviews:\n book one | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605book two | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605book three | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606Blog | Goodreads | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube"}, {"Review": "I\u2019m sorry\u2026 but did you expect anything less that 5 Stars for my absolute Queen?!Perhaps being parabatai was a weakness that could trap you. But so was any kind of love, and if love was weakness, it was strength, too.Before I get into this review those illustrations were EVERYTHING! They were so beautiful and the detail! It made me so happy!So I\u2019m not going to lie this review will more than likely be rusty as I haven\u2019t done one for quite a while now so I shall try none the less. Just a pre warning in the things I like and the things I don\u2019t like there will be minor spoilers so you can just stop at that point if you haven\u2019t ready this already.Going to this I was a bag of nerves, I knew that it would be heart wrenching after what happened in Lord of Shadows but the way in which grief is portrayed throughout was just so raw and dealt with in different ways by all of the characters. I didn\u2019t know where the story would take us with the final instalment and I\u2019d be lying if I said this was what I expected, but that kind of makes me enjoy it even more.Luckily I\u2019d read all of the tales from Ghosts of the Shadow Market which were very useful going into this because of how much background we got in relation to a specific character so knowing what I did I was very very worried in regards to that, it was very interesting seeing it all come together though!What I love so much about this series is the characters, there\u2019s honestly no one (other than Zara and the Cohort) that I dislike, I love stories that have strong relationships and this has so much love between the characters you can\u2019t help but become invested in them.The way in which it ended, I am so surprised, it\u2019s not what I expected what so ever and now I\u2019m super intrigued to find out what\u2019s to come, if there\u2019s not another series I WILL RIOT!\u201cSome lights were never meant to burn for long.\u201dCharactersTo start with Emma and Julian, honestly all the way throughout I was so worried for what was to come, their love for one another is just so strong and I just wanted them to be happy, IS THAT TOO MUCH TO ASK! Emma is still the strong character from the previous books, and her development from Lady Midnight to this was amazing particularly in one chapter where she realises something and that she has t overcome that and move away from it. My heart for Julian broke, he goes through such a rough patch and seeing what he does to himself DESTROYED me. His care for his siblings and Emma is just undeniable.Then we have the trio that is of course Cristina, Mark and Kieran! I never in my life thought I would enjoy a trio again from Will, Jem and Tessa, but here we are! The balance between them all is just so pure and perfect. They all just fit together in ways that just balance each other out, Cristina is such a loving character and probable;y the purest soul in this book, she is so open and honest and her love for people, ahhh she\u2019s so lovely! Mark is Mark, the things he does and says, they are just so lovable and you know he just tries his hardest to help, the small gestures he does throughout I was NOT coping! Then finally Kieran, I can honestly say that in this, Kieran is my favourite character, He was just so funny and he really came into his own, his love is fierce and when he feels something strongly he will try his best. There is so much I want to say and rave on about but I\u2019m trying to keep this section spoiler free, but I love him!Kit and Ty were the two characters I worried about the most after everything that happened in Lord of Shadows, and I don\u2019t think I\u2019m alone in this thought, Ty has to come to terms with a lot, and boy does it get deep! My heart is broken for him, and it was so sad to see the lengths he went to throughout. Then we have Kit another personal favourite of mine, I am very very intrigued by him. Once again I felt sorry for him, he was trying to help Ty, but at the same time trying to deal with other things going on with himself, he is just too precious!I don\u2019t think I really knew much about Dru, Helen and Aline, just the snippets every now and again. Drug for me was SUCH a good character, I liked her friendships with Ty and Kit and her realising her own self worth, it was just nice to see her being able to do small things to help the people she loves and cared about. Aline was so fierce anything relating to making Helen upset Aline took zero bull shit and I LIVED for it, coming into that environment she handled it so well and I just adored her love for Helen, it was just so sweet. I honestly felt for Helen, she\u2019d been away from her family for such a long period of time and to see her bond with her family made me so happy! At times I felt frustrated for her but the way she handled things I felt so proud!My least favourites\u2026 Zara and The Cohort I legit hate them all. They were devious and sneaky (but I love to hate characters) and you can\u2019t not hate them. Now as much as I dislike them some of the things they did were clever but still not a fan, I just want to slap them all and I like to think of myself as quite a nice person aha!Finally Diana, Gwyn, Alec, Magnus, Jace and Clary, I know this is a weird bunch to put together but it\u2019s probably easier this way because it\u2019s just little things. Diana was of course great and what she did YES GIRL! Gwyn once again enjoyed! It was nice to see Jace and Clary again, they\u2019re not my favourite characters but it was still good! Alec and Magnus! I\u2019d forgot how much they were in Lord of Shadows but I honestly love their defiance and how they work together the simple things make me happy! Pre Warning there will be spoilers aheadI love you. I love you. I love you.What I liked?- Some nice little references to previous books (Will Herondale of course)- Ty tryin to get to Livvy, my god my poor little heart, but it was such a Ty thing to do and just ARGH- Seeing the family Dynamics, it was so lovely to see Helen and Aline back- Ty gave Kit his first Witchlight! Come onnnnnnnn- I didn\u2019t mention this earlier BUT the Trio relationship, I never knew I needed this but turns out I 1000000% do, I am here for it! I could go on and on, but I loved Kierans description of why they were perfect as a unit and it was everything!- All of the tension, nothing going right, just forever hoping for some Peace!- Perfect Diego helping Kieran along with Divya, I liked seeing a bit inside the Scholomance- All of the feeeeeeels- Kieran pretending to be asleep because he felt awkward\u2026 dead :\u2019)- Helen sitting on Kieran and him asking her to move because it\u2019s painful (these one liners have me every time)- Emma taking the Tapestry\u2026 absolute gold!- The names of the Downworlders \u201dMy name is Greg. Greg Anderson.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s Elton John, said Aline grabbing a stamp\u201d - Another Kieran moment\u2026 calling his brother a Turnip- Goodbye Arm, you know when you know!- Dru and Kieran with the mugs- That LETTER! I was like no no no no no- Seeing the relationships with so many Parabatai is was very interesting and also heart wrenching at the same time!- Now Julian steps up a lot but what he does in this with sending of the letters and the resistance it was so engaging to read, you could see his thought process and you could see just how smart he actually is. Not only that but the BANNER, I was ugly crying, full blown tears!- Dru asking Kit to teach her things and becoming a True Con Woman!- Kit and just how loving and protective he is towards Ty, he knows how to deal with him and just AHHH I CAN\u2019T!- That T-SHIRT! hahahahahahahahahahaha- The cake :\u2019)- Magnus being able to talk to Ty, it was just such a lovely moment because he just seemed to understand, I know a lot of the other characters too, but Magnus is different in his own way and helped Ty a lot.- Kitten calendars!What I didn\u2019t like?- I wasn\u2019t particularly fond of Thule, I get why it had to happen and I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s because of how I was feeling at the time, I think because it was mainly focusing on Julian and Emma and I missed the other characters at that time.- KIT DESERVED MORE! I am low key sad at how he parted with the Blackthorns and in particular Ty, but I kind of get it if there\u2019s more books to come because SURELY it will be about them reconnecting maybe? Although I do like that he\u2019s with Jem and Tessa!- My expectations going in\u2026 I kind of also thought there\u2019d be more of Annabel and Ash. I\u2019d guessed in Lord of Shadows that Ash was going to be important but we didn\u2019t really see either of them that much.- I also kind of expected more with Manuel, when we see small snippets from his point of view I thought something more was going to happen unless this is setting him up for the next books\u201cThe sky was a road and the stars made pathways; the moon was a watchtower, a lighthouse that led you home.\u201d Overall I\u2019m so happy with the way this turned out, it was my most anticipated release for the year and it didn\u2019t disappoint! It\u2019s bittersweet that it\u2019s over but hopefully there will be more to come.

This took place on the last day of classes for the autumn term though, so I had to hustle to the event after class! (Guess who was still crazy early? Haha, this girl! *raises hand*)- Let's see what I remember. Phones weren't permitted to be used during the event, and I'm a goody-two shoes (no matter how much of a badarse I imagine myself to be), so I couldn't take any notes, ugh.- This event took place in a huge, university auditorium. Cassie was in conversation with Carrie Ryan at the event, who, if I'm being totally honest, I hadn't heard of until then. Carrie wasn't that engaging of an interviewer, so I can't recall much about her, sorry. - Cassie is a very funny interviewee. She's as funny in person as she is in her books.- One anecdote that she told wasn't even hers! LMAO, oh Cassie! xD Essentially, she took credit for a really funny story about her bestie, Holly Black, when it really involved Holly and Kelly Link. If you want the full details, check out my Wicked King signing. Holly had a good laugh about it, when she found out Cassie lied about it!-Another anecdote DID involve Holly. The two of them went to upstate New York to an apparently haunted, mental institution for research. They weren't allowed in because the building was condemned, I believe. Long story short, the two of them hopped the fence and snuck in, only to be discovered by the police, LOL. They told the police that they're authors, in an effort to avoid being arrested for trespassing, and the police were like, \"Oh, you mean like a historical novel about New York?\" and Cassie goes, \"No, it's a book about demons\"...to which the police responded, \"Get outta here before we arrest you!\" xD- The audience also had the opportunity to ask her questions, some of which turned into them thanking her for all of the different types of representation in her novels, which I thought was really sweet.- There was a trivia section with REALLY HARD QUESTIONS btw, so naturally I didn't win any of the prizes, some of which were a Magnus plushie and an ARC of the Red Scrolls of Magic. - We weren't allowed to bring backlist titles from home and were only permitted to have our new copies of Queen of Air and Darkness signed and personalised. Oh! And we also received Shadowhunter Army pins at the event. It had this insignia on it:- This portion of the event was really impersonal because of how many people were in attendance. There were SO MANY! The signing-line tickets were assigned in the order of purchases (kind of like at a delicatessen, where you are assigned a ticket number), and I was letter F, so it wasn't too bad of a wait for me. The part I didn't like is that we could only say about a sentence to her before we were hurried away from the signing table (in an assembly line-esque fashion), so that they could get to the next people. Also, we couldn't have actual photos with Cassie. The staff from the booksellers took \"action shots\" as we were getting our book signed. - I remember telling her that I've been reading her books since 2007 and they've had such a huge impact on my life (I kind of panicked; I was a bit starstruck, haha) and she responded with, \"Well, thanks for sticking with my books for so long.\" OMG GUYS, I WAS WITHIN BREATHING DISTANCE OF CASSIE CLARE AND I SPOKE TO HER AND SHE SPOKE TO ME AND OMG!!! <3- I think, because of this, if I hadn't added this section about my experience here, I would have forgotten what my feelings were about meeting one of my favourite authors in person. I'm so grateful that I had the opportunity to do so, as I know that there are many people who haven't. She was really lovely and nice, and I'd definitely jump at the chance to see her again...but hopefully, it'll be a bit smaller???"}, {"Review": "Your age does not define how well or not you will/would like a book.Just because this is labeled as a YA book and you will be twenty something when it comes out doesn't mean that you can't enjoy it.If you are a big fan of Clare's series and end up reading it how ever old you may be, that's awesome. If you don't end up reading it, no big deal. I just don't see why people need to be saying that \"this is the last Clare/Shadowhunter book I'll be reading\" because it hasn't even come out yet, nor have any books of this series for a matter of fact. If you're not excited for it, then you're not excited for it, but don't be thinking negitively about a book series that hasn't even come out yet. Please and thank you."}, {"Review": "SPOILER REVIEWTrigger Warnings: grief, self mutilation, death, war, murderMy review for Queen of Air and Darkness by Cassandra Clare was first posted on my blog. Find it here.Queen of Air and Darkness is the book I have been waiting for all year. I don\u2019t think I have ever anticipated a Cassandra Clare book as much as this one. The ending of Lord of Shadows scared me to my core and if you ask me about it today you have a 110% chance of me bursting into tears at the mere mention of it. This finale to The Dark Artifices series did not disappoint. It left me reeling and having so many damn questions. You can bet I screamed WHAT at my book around about 100 times a page. I was absolutely shattered.This finale will probably be Cassie\u2019s best. They continue to get better the more she writes and I am so damn happy to be able to experience this journey with everyone as we dive into the Shadowhunter realms. I am also self-proclaimed Shadowhunter trash \u2013 while also seeing everything wrong with the books and Cassie, I\u2019m not blinded, don\u2019t worry.As a warning, this review will contain spoilers. The spoilers will be for the previous books in this series so you have been warned. I can\u2019t talk about this book without mentioning certain events. If you haven\u2019t read this series, come back after you do so we can discuss. If you haven\u2019t read this series and don\u2019t want to, read forward and be spoiled, my friends.Queen of Air and Darkness picks up exactly where Lord of Shadows dropped off. With Julian holding Livvy after she has been murdered. We get to experience every ounce of grief that the Blackthorn family feels throughout the book and it is honestly enough to knock you off your feet. I promise you that you will burst into tears several times at work\u2026not that I did that. The finale of The Dark Artifices takes you on a journey. There are countless storylines and at times it is a tad difficult to keep up. Obviously, it is better to have read all the Shadowhunter Chronicles to understand how people relate to certain things but it really isn\u2019t needed. You can jump into this series and scream \u2013 obviously don\u2019t just jump into Queen of Air and Darkness without having read the previous books.Throughout this book we get to follow Julian and Emma\u2019s struggle to tamper down their feelings, Ty dealing with his grief for Livvy in the wrong way, Kit being a Herondale, Drusilla coming in to herself, Diana and Gwyn\u2019s love story continue, Cristina, Kieran and Mark drama, Cohort business (seriously this was some Donald Trump shit), some Faerie Drama and finally find out who the mysterious Ash is (we all knew). Within 800 pages a lot has to happen and it does. We get to see all the old characters whom we loved and I even found myself liking Clary and Jace \u2013 something I thought was impossible when I read The Mortal Instruments. I can barely even begin to talk about each plot line because there is just so much going on. You will be thrown in a whirlwind and be actively engaged no matter who\u2019s the storyline you are reading. There are plenty of changes throughout the long ass chapters Cassie writes to get a feel for everyone.I should probably start off with the one thing I disliked about Queen of Air and Darkness. I don\u2019t know if I ever publicly spoke about it on my blog but anti-hero Julian was all that I ever wanted in this series. To see Cassie jump outside her comfort zone and write him would fuel me. While we did get somewhat of an antihero Julian it was not what I had imagined. In fact, it was slightly disappointing and something I\u2019m not sure added to the plot. Julian turning off his feelings simply felt weak. You\u2019re telling me the boy who walked miles to get groceries for his siblings would turn off his feelings for them? Try again.That\u2019s all I didn\u2019t like though, so Cassie really did smash it out of the park.Throughout the series, we have had glimpses of Aline and Helen. We have never really gotten to see them which is disheartening as the only f/f couple in the series. We finally get to really meet them and I must say that I adore them. Aline was so damn relatable to me and Helen was just an angel who wanted to care for her siblings, even if they didn\u2019t want her to. The couple themselves were so damn sweet and I adored every moment of their relationship on the page. They were truly so special to read. I am sure we\u2019ll see more of them in future books as well which has me squealing with excitement.There wasn\u2019t much Jem and Tessa in this book either which was fantastic. If you know me, you\u2019d know I hate that ship. I get it. Everyone thinks it is the best love triangle to ever exist in the sense that you can\u2019t \u2018choose\u2019. Bitch, I chose and now I can\u2019t like Jem. I hate him. So, having not much of them throughout this book was fantastic. Though I could have done with more Simon and Isabelle, oh well.Interdimensional travel is typically something that turns me off a book. However, Thule was magnificent. A world completely opposite from the one our character lives in where Sebastian Morgenstern won the war. It was chilling. The fact that Cassie thought of that? Ugh, her mind. She is a genius. However, she really didn\u2019t include as much Annabel as I thought she would considering she is on the cover. I wonder where that will come in to play?The relationships in this book as well. Cassie diving in to a poly relationship was fantastic, Cassie\u2019s further development of Emma and Julian was brilliant, Magnus and Alec\u2019s already established relationship filled me with joy and I don\u2019t even like them, and lastly, Drusilla\u2019s future love life will probably be complicated but y\u2019all know I love her.Cassandra Clare carefully crafted it so every single plotline that ran through this story intersected at the end. They all came together in a big way that you know leads off into the next series. I can truly not wait to read whatever she puts out next. I honestly need it in my hands like yesterday. The ending of this particular story left me breathless. I can\u2019t wait to see what hints that we found throughout this book to come to fruition in future books.I would desperately love for Cassie to give us a nice happy ending for the Blackthorns but with the fact that The Wicked Powers is based around Kit and Ty (who I can\u2019t even begin to talk about in this book) tells me this family hasn\u2019t had the last of its dramas.Overall, Queen of Air and Darkness will probably be my favourite book of 2018. I am still reeling from the events and want to scream about them from the rooftops. Heck, this is the first review I\u2019ve sat down to write straight after finishing the book. Cassandra Clare gives us a bit of everything in this finale and even more. I can\u2019t wait to hear everyone\u2019s thoughts and theories on what will happen next."}, {"Review": "THAT ENDING HOLY SHIT. Review to come.________\nPre-read Rambles\nI AM SO EXCITED FOR THIS\u2013BUT OH SO TERRIFIED PREPARE YOURSELVES!

Ok I love this series. I absolutely am obsessed with it. My hEarT. Of course finales come with so many expectations, but this was amazing. But then I am Shadowhunter trash and these books can do no wrong afjdskald. I will say that is is incredibly hard to write a review...my brain is a smooshed swirl of emotions.but basically: GOOD JOB BOOK. YOU RIPPED ME IN HALF AND ALSO HEALED MY SOUL. BLESS. \u27b8 My ships. MY SHIPS.Look I had expectations and wishes, and they were met. Although, I mean, I had a lot of cool theories that didn't happen -- GOD I WISH I WROTE FANFIC because I have thoughts. But anyway, I love the romance in these. I know we roll our eyes a lot at the whole \"It's the end of the world but you're kissing right now???\" thing. But also: it makes sense. Like at one point Cristina told Emma she had romance problems and Emma was like, THANK GOD. LET'S TALK ABOUT THAT INSTEAD OF DEATH. So I get that??? I think it's entirely natural that a bunch of teens who are stressed to the point of breaking will find comfort and longing in kissing one (or two idk go for it, childs) another.also fkkkkk I LOVE MY SHIPS.(view spoiler)[ Ok here's the thing though: I WANTED Kieran x Cristina x Mark to get together like nothing else. And they DID. POLY REP OMG. But I also wanted them to be forever-together, because apparently I am built of tree sap. I wanted Kieran to marry Cristina and Mark and they all live as faerie kings/queens. Idk don't judge me. I had my heart set on this. Not just like weekend flings in a cottage smh. So it's like 80% of a win storyline. But yeah :/ How are they going to raise their CHILDREN like this. (They have no kids, hush. I'm just saying.)  (hide spoiler)]\u27b8 How my heart beats for my Blackthorns.The family is so STRESSED here omg and devastated and wrecked. I love how they all tore away from each other and realised it wasn't helping. Helen is a sweetheart gift, I'm so glad she's here to be mum/big sister!! Mark continues to be SO PURE and wholesome afjdksald I love him. (He like makes donut sandwiches and he's so pleased with himself arranging the plates.) I love that Julian just SNAPPED because he held up for so long, it was good to see a human side. Dru got way more of a part and I loved it!! THE BLACKTHORNS ARE EVERYTHING.I also just want to say I really really love Kieren. Far too much afjdklsa my faerie, dramatic deadly son. And Cristina !!!! LOVE CRISTINA!! Also Diana. And Kit is precious and his story has only just begun so afjdklsad I cannot wait for his trilogy even though it's going to be forever till it comes AHHHH.\u27b8  Was it too long???Here's the thing: 50% of me loved every. frikkin'. page. Because I want maximum time with my children. However, the book was genuinely uncomfortable to hold. It took me forever to finish it because my brain was screaming \"READ MORE!!\" but it physically hurt to hold. I knoooow. There are kindles. But I just think it should've been a bit shorter. Or two books? Two books would've been fine.\u27b8 The plot was INTENSE THOUGH.So much happened like afjdksald I'm a whirlwind. It's impossible to talk about the details without spoilers though, so I'm just living it as: it was so long, but yet never dull. I loved how it balances the soft moments (with coffee and cuddles and coloured pencil smudges and beach kisses) with the hardcore action moments (fighting in Faerie, slashing swords, using impossible magic, badass battles, heartwrenching traumaaaaa). \u27b8 I also have NO idea how Cassandra Clare keeps this all straight in her head. 0_0I'm just...wow. There are so many threads, so many details (like who has which knife and how that's important later) and it just boggles my mind!! The histories all twine together and reference each other and it's just Good\u2122 and clever.\u27b8 And it doesn't spare the emotions.I LAUGHED. I CRIED. I WAS A MESS. I was like anxiety laughing all the time??? There's less sassy comebacks in this one because the book is SO DARK. But god, I live for the one-liners. But seriously it ripped me to pieces AND it was satisfying and good.I THINK THE THING TO TAKE AWAY HERE IS THAT I LIKED THIS BOOK. Just a little. Not much obviously. I'm chill. *hACKS UP A LUNG* It gave me what I desperately wanted with my sons' ships. It gave me maximum Blackthorn time. There was mercy AND vengeance. There were plot twists, cunning schemes, and love. It was the kind of emotional wave that you just stand there, fists clenched, and scream for a very long time bECAUSE YOU FEEL TOO MANY THINGS AT ONCE.ugh ok. I need to go cry until The Red Scrolls of Magic and Chain of Gold are out. \"But I thought -- you said we would be done with each other.\"\"I am not done with you,\" said Kieran. \"I could never be done with you, Mark Blackthorn.\"\"I am also an excellent cooke,\" said Mark, putting an acorn onto his s'more. Everyone stared.\"He can't help it,\" said Cristina loyally. \"He has lived with the Wild Hunt for so long.\"\"I don't do that,\" said Kieran, eating a s'more in the correct fashion. \"Mark has no excuse.\""}, {"Review": "\nThings I liked:\n \u25d8 Cassandra Clare\u2019s writing continues to improve immensely and was beautiful.\u25d8 Lord Byron and Edgar Allan Poe have been two of my favourite poets since high school, and this book was partially inspired by poems from BOTH of them.\u25d8 It had an abundance of hard-hitting, emotional moments. But they were also balanced out by the funny, light-hearted, happy, tender moments. \u25d8 EMMA AND THE BLACKTHORNS. They were the highlight as usual. Their immense love for each other hurts me.\u25d8 Little moments such as Mark\u2019s balloon animals for the kids, or (view spoiler)[Aline\u2019s (hide spoiler)] \u201cgoddamn delicious\u201d frittata make the series what it is. \u25d8 Julian\u2019s art and artistic analogies give me life.\u25d8 Emma\u2019s no-nonsense attitude. Sure it gets them into trouble sometimes, but I love her for it?\u25d8 I don\u2019t like picking favourites but if I HAD to pick my single favourite character it would be Church Emma. \u25d8 Marks character development since book 1 was fanfreakingtastic. I remember him using faerie prose and putting Tavvy in bags of sugar, but now he\u2019s referring to Shadowhunters as \u201cwe\u201d and not \u201cthey\u201d. He\u2019s come so far :\u201d)\u25d8 Magnus was a blindingly glittery star. \u25d8 At one point it felt like things were just on repeat, but then something happens that FLIPS EVERYTHING ON ITS HEAD AND I LOVED IT.\u25d8 That damn strip of red cloth hurt me.\u25d8 The message that the Cold Peace was the opposite of peaceful and instead brought war. \u25d8 The disarray within the Council was captured well, and is reflective of political chaos in today\u2019s societies. \u201cPeople are terrified. And fear isn\u2019t logical,\u201d \u201c...and we seek to control what we fear.\u201d(view spoiler)[\u25d8 There were two things that took me completely off guard:1. The whole Thule ordeal was my favourite. It was giving me serious Shrek: The Final Chapter And Gemina vibes.2. The Cohort\u2019s stunt at the end, Kit\u2019s reveal and corrupt Jace, which set up Wicked Powers.\u25d8 My darling alternate universe Livvy possessed such bravery, such strength \ud83d\ude2d\u25d8 How actual photographic evidence couldn\u2019t convince alternate universe Livvy that Emma and her brother were real, but Julian\u2019s drawings could. That genuinely made me tear up. \u25d8 Livvy\u2019s letter to Ty was beautiful, poetic and so very heartbreaking. The \u201cI love you. I love you. I love you.\u201d from Livvy to her twin. A small part of me died and something in that letter just made me sit there and weep like the walking tragedy I am. \u25d8 The fact that they named the resistance Livia\u2019s Watch \ud83d\ude2d and JULIANS BANNER.\u25d8 Julian being scared out of his mind and being driven to turn his emotions off. \u201cWhat hurts more,\u201d Magnus asked, \u201cthe love or the hate?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Julian said.\u201d THAT SCENE.\u25d8 All of the Blackthorns are growing up, dispersing in their own directions and moving on with their lives, and I feel like that aspect was captured really well. The change felt scary, and very very bitter-sweet, like it does in real life.\u201cAs long as you know home is always waiting for you,\u201d said Julian.\u201d\u25d8 Michael Wayland, Robert Lightwood\u2019s parabatai. I wasn\u2019t expecting an appearance, but when he showed up at Robert\u2019s funeral it was a tragic kind of wonderful. (hide spoiler)]\nThings I disliked:\n\u25d8 In Lady Midnight and Lord of Shadows, you\u2019d be able to read them without having read The Mortal Instruments while still being able to get pretty much the full effect. But I feel like this book was more dependent on fully understanding the events of the past: The Battle of the Burren, the formation of the Cold Peace, Valentine\u2019s Circle (view spoiler)[and Sebastian\u2019s history. (hide spoiler)]\u25d8 Not going to lie, the book made me roll my eyes more than a few times. \u25d8 I HATE, loathe, abhor, detest, despise the Mark-Christina-Kieran triangle thingamajig I\u2019m sorry. \u25d8 This has been the case with all of Cassandra Clare\u2019s books, but not every single character (including all of the side characters) needs to have a dramatic romantic subplot or love interest. If we replaced some of that stuff with more page time for Emma and the Blackthorns, I would\u2019ve been a happy camper.\u25d8 Why do I have to share a name with the Dearborn witch?(view spoiler)[\u25d8 \u201cI talked to Jem at the meeting,\u201d Emma said. \u201cHe told me he would never do it, never.\u201d This is a prime example of characters withholding information from each other for the sake of plot convenience.\u25d8 That flipping parabatai curse and the unoriginality of how it was resolved. Two kids with a forbidden romance and heavenly fire burning within them save everybody with their vast power and are looked upon as angels from then on. Sound familiar? Yup, thought so. \u25d8 This is a pivotal moment that the entire trilogy has been leading up to and it fell SO so so flat for me. I was expecting something more epic and explosive with more consequences. \u25d8 \u201cWe lost good warriors on the battlefield, but your friends are safe.\u201dSigh. Not sigh of relief. Sigh of dismay and incredulity. Cassandra Clare has never liked killing off major characters, but I thought she broke out of that mould with Livvy\u2019s death. But again, everyone survived the battle. It makes it feel like the book lacks stakes, and it\u2019s plain unrealistic. \u25d8 Yes, I know that we see many tragic deaths in Thule, but that felt like a cop out because all of those characters were alive in their actual world. (hide spoiler)]\nMore quotes that I liked (there are a lot of them):\n\u25d8 \u201cShe told me once there is a clock in the hearts of parents. Most of the time it is silent, but you can hear it ticking when your child is not with you and you do not know where they are...\u201d \u25d8 \u201cBe careful what masks you wear, child,\u201d Nene said, \u201clest you lose your true face forever.\u201d\u25d8 \u201cIt requires mortality to make art. The knowledge of death, of things limited. There is fire inside us, Emma, and as it blazes, it burns us, and the burning causes pain\u2014but without its light, I cannot see to draw.\u201d\u25d8 \u201c...but sometimes you wanted to focus on something trivial to take your mind off the apocalypse.\u201d\u25d8 \u201cOnce you dissolve dye in water, you can\u2019t take it back out.\u201d\u25d8 \u201cHe\u2019d always called it her Wall of Crazy, but in a lot of ways Emma thought of it as a wall of sanity,\u201d\u25d8 \u201cI can\u2019t tell you it gets easier. But it does get steadier; you learn how to live with the new rocking of the new earth, the way sailors gain sea legs.\u201d\u25d8 \u201c...and I\u2019m worth talking to without pretending I\u2019m something I\u2019m not. And I\u2019m not going to bother with anyone who doesn\u2019t see that.\u201d Wise words from miss Drusilla Blackthorn.\u25d8 \u201cIt does no one any good to look backward for too long and forget that the future lies ahead.\u201d(view spoiler)[\u25d8 \u201cEntreat me not to leave thee,\u201d she said, reaching for the doorknob, \u201cbut you\u2019ve left me. You\u2019ve left me, Julian.\u201d\u25d8 \u201cBut I felt it. I was living in black and white and now the color is back.\u201d\u25d8 \u201cIn the club yesterday you talked about the weight on you, crushing you. In our world, your last words were \u2018I\u2019ve never felt so light.\u2019\u200a\u200a\u201d\u25d8 \u201c...but I can\u2019t have Cameron die for the safety of a world that I\u2019m willing to run away from.\u201d\u25d8 \u201cYou are in the cage.\u201d [\u2026]\u201cI am in the cage with you.\u201d\u25d8 \u201cI thought I\u2019d be able to think more clearly, without feelings. But the opposite is true. I can\u2019t think at all.\u201d\u25d8 \u201cMaybe Arthur had been right. Maybe mercy was better than revenge.\u201d (hide spoiler)]The majority of the book: Unreserved 5 stars 60-or-so pages during the climax: Dismal, heartbreaking 3.5 starsOverall rating: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\u00beUhh for anyone still reading this, my condolences.

I WILL BURN THIS BOOK."}, {"Review": "Quick thoughts before the review:I liked it more than the previous books but I still have some mixed feelings about it.The wedding scene at the end was adorable and I am glad Emma didn't break the bond but the while thing in the other dimension was way too off. I felt like it was cheating because we had already faced Sebastian (even with Emma needing closure) and also I just never could take Annabelle seriously enough to think about her as the real threat. So, that fell flat for me. The Seelie Queen is still the biggest danger and I wonder how long can these books feed off that.But yeah, I kind of liked it but still it was nothing stellar.All the Blackthorns stood out as usual and old beloved characters were there doing stuff I guess."}, {"Review": "So I have thoughts. I have a lot of thoughts. First off this trilogy is over which is extremely sad considering it was one of my favorites of all time\ud83d\ude2d. But with the way this book ended we know for sure that the next series is going to be as action packed as this one. This book was extremely beautiful and the representation that was shown was so very well done and I was so so happy to read this trilogy. I'm gonna miss Emma and Julian so much. They were definitely two of the best protagonists I've read about. This book just tied everything together and the way Cassandra Clare shows that 'Love conquers all' is literally what made the book even more special. I'm so happy I read this because I was in a terrible reading slump for almost a month and it was so hard for me to get out of it but I did and now I have exams going on..how tragic. I can't wait for Cassie's next book."}, {"Review": "More like \n1.5 stars\n!?! Believe me, no one is more surprised (and saddened) by this than I am. This might as well be my most disappointing book of 2018. I had to put it down halfway through and finished two other novels. That much I dreaded picking this one back up.Is it wrong to say that it didn\u2019t feel like a Cassandra Clare TDA book? Compared to LoS, which is still my favourite in this series, this read like a much-diluted version of her TDA Shadowhunter universe, the characters were boring me to death with their endless conversations and the plot pacing was all over the place. I couldn\u2019t bring myself to care about any of it. Having this many shifting POVs and subplots (Emma, Julian, Cristina, Mark, Kieran, Kit, Dru, Diana, Helen, Diego, Manuel - completely unnecessary and not very convincing as a rather cowardly psychopath, I am surprised Church didn\u2019t get a say in this) makes for a dull and highly predictable read, because, if not handled properly, it simply repeats things over and over again.I\u2019ll give you an example: take Kieran, Cristina & Mark and make \u201clast night\u201d happen; have Cristina and Mark talk about said last night; have Mark and Kieran talk about it; have Kieran, Cristina and Mark talk about it; have Emma AND Cristina talk about it; have Kieran and Adaon talk, in a roundabout way, about it; have Kieran, Cristina and Mark talk about it some more. See where I\u2019m going with this? There\u2019s so much Kierarktina??? talk in this book that, to me, it overshadows the other relationships and friendships. I get that Cassie wanted to do it right, but it\u2019s just too much. It reads like a fanfic wet dream.The entire Thule episode was ridiculously weird, recycling plot and restoring characters that should have been left where they belonged: in the fictional bin! Also, (view spoiler)[am I the only one who thought of the alternate dimension they pulled off in the TV show while reading this? Granted, here everything a lot darker, less sparkly. (hide spoiler)]There were some many emotional moments in LM and LoS that had me basically yell \u201cHow dare you?\u201d at my own books. The grief and other intense emotions here were watered down by the constant shifting of perspective: you couldn\u2019t spend enough time in a character\u2019s mind to get a sense of what they\u2019re really feeling. This review could be waaay longer, as I took notes (with loads of exclamation marks & WTFs), but right now I can\u2019t be bothered... I might sound like a broken record with this one, but it needn\u2019t have been a 900+ book! Who\u2019s surprised by the Epilogue? Not me\u2026 Ughhh. I was over Clace like four books ago.I feel like we went back to TMI with this one!"}], "Genre": "Fantasy", "ID": "13541056", "Desc": ""}
