{"Genre": "Fantasy", "ID": "29056083", "Name": "Harry Potter and the Cursed Child: Parts One and Two", "Reviews": [{"Review": "ALL MAJOR SPOILERS ARE HIDDEN.Ok, I actually went into this with zero spoilers and very few expectations so that I'd enjoy whatever it turned out to be. I mean, I like scripts. Harry Potter is my life. We're good. So I really tried not to compare this to the HP books or look at it as an intense fan, but it's pretty underwhelming no matter how you approach it...The story picks up at the end of the Deathly Hallows epilogue where Harry, Ron, Hermione, Ginny, and Malfoy are seeing their kids leave on the Hogwarts Express. It's the first year of Hogwarts for Albus Severus Potter, Rose Granger-Weasley, and Scorpius Malfoy. Albus Severus gets sorted into (view spoiler)[SLYTHERIN. WHAAAAT heck yes. (hide spoiler)], sucks at quidditch, and turns out to be a very average wizard. The kid's pretty sulky about being compared to his father and has a chip on his shoulder the size of Grawp. His best/only friend Scorpius is dealing with rumors that Draco used a time turner and Scorpius is actually the son of Voldemort, so both kids are kind of outcasts. I'll explain the plot below in the spoiler bracket, but it's basically the wizarding version of \"It's a Wonderful Life.\"I think this was a risky undertaking because so much of the Harry Potter fandom already has an idea of either what happens after the epilogue (through fanfiction or their own ideas), or else they already said goodbye to the characters and wrapped everything up. I was mostly just looking forward to just seeing some familiar faces and places again, but was kind of let down in that regard. The plot seemed to be a string of events that producers thought were the highlights of the series, rather than the sort of touching everyday scenes that makes Harry Potter what it is. I wanted to see the kids at Hogwarts playing quidditch, going to class, eating, or just interacting. Instead this play is a breakneck pace of: polyjuice potion! ministry infiltration! angst! time turners! more polyjuice potion! triwizard tournament flashbacks! is Voldemort back?!? WHAT IS EVEN HAPPENING.By 6% of the way through the story Albus is already in his fourth year at school. So there really wasn't a lot at Hogwarts or much in the way of an actual fun \"Harry Potter\" type story. There were a million directions this story could've gone in and it did feel like they tried to do too much with the little time they had. So Harry\u2019s scar starts hurting and the basic plot is:(view spoiler)[Albus and Scorpius break out of the Hogwarts Express in their fourth year (and avoid the trolley witch who's SO CREEPY and has been working that job for 199 years and chases them onto the roof with exploding chocolate frogs like some possessed robot? WTF). The 2 friends then use polyjuice potion to break into the office of the Minister of Magic (who is Hermione) in order to steal a time turner so they can go back and save Cedric Diggory. (I would hope that the ministry would have better security by now but whatever). Albus Severus \"knows what it is to be the spare\" and wants to get some of the blood off his father's hands/do something good. So they go back in time to the first Triwizard task and pose as Durmstrang students while they hear Ludo Bagman say cringeworthy things like \"Cedric Delicious Diggory\" and \"Harry Plucky Potter.\" This time turner only lets them go back in time for 5 minutes, but they still manage to make Hermione think that Viktor Krum's buddies sabotaged Cedric, so she never goes to the Yule Ball with Viktor. She goes with Ron instead, so he was never jealous -- they just stayed friends, he married Padma, and Rose was never born. Soooo then in the present Hermione has turned into this super mean Defense Against the Dark Arts professor who bullies students and takes points away from everyone, Albus is in Gryffindor, and NOBODY IS THE SAME (except Harry supposedly still is even while he's bullying McGonagall to stalk his son). So then they go back in time to sabotage the second task, but only Scorpius returns to the present because Albus was never born. Umbridge is now headmistress and it's currently Voldemort Day to celebrate the day they killed Harry Potter and stopped the Dumbledore's Army terrorists at the Battle of Hogwarts. Draco is now the head of Magical Law Enforcement and \"Potter\" is a curse word (which was the only part of this mess I appreciated). Cedric Diggory is a death eater who killed Neville Longbottom, so Scorpius decides the best way to fix the present is to go back in time to save Neville to make sure he kills Nagini... because there are clearly NO OTHER PLOT HOLES HERE. So Scorpius goes to find Professor Snape who is still a jerk who's unwilling to help until Lily's name is evoked. Then Snape brings Scorpius to Ron & Hermione's DA hiding place under the Whomping Willow where Scorpius tells the pair that they\u2019re married in another future. A lot of weird stuff happens really quickly and ends with Ron & Hermione having their souls sucked out by dementors after they're all \"kiss me, I love you\" to each other. Umbridge shows up and starts spewing dark magic and floating in front of Snape, who also gets the Dementor's Kiss (after he clarifies that he believed in Lily's cause and that there was \"glory in being taken down by the Dark Lord himself\"). Then Scorpius returns to the present and all is well?BUT WAIT. Some random woman to whom Albus was attracted at the start (she claimed to be Amos Diggory's niece idk) turns out to be the real daughter of Bellatrix + Voldemort. She steals the time turner and goes back to Godric's Hollow to make sure Voldemort only grows in power by never trying to kill Harry. So Albus Severus & Scorpius follow her and manage to send a message to Harry about where they are through a few really fortunate plot devices. At least the adults actually get competent at the end, though? Draco shows up at Harry's house with some time-turner he's been hiding and all of the adults go back in time. Harry turns into Voldemort and confronts the daughter. Then it all ends with Harry having the chance to stop the real Voldemort from murdering his parents but choosing to stand there and watch his mother in the window, his dad's bravery, and their death. The end. (hide spoiler)]It's just a string of WTF on every level. And if you're going to make the plot that big of a free-for-all, why not have Snape go back to the orphanage and kill Tom Riddle as a kid like that youtube video did??!In the end it felt more like a roundup of characters and events they thought fans would want to see instead of a true, original Hogwarts story for Albus Severus and Scorpius. I really didn't need any villain associated with Voldemort... that's old news. That whole story has come to a close and there should be a way to revisit this world without needing to go back to rehash the past.I was also a bit disappointed that the characters in this all have the personalities of their movie versions instead. Ron is a bit of a bumbling idiot (who didn't remember much of his own wedding because he was so drunk), Ginny is still missing part of her personality (and doesn't let Harry eat sugar?), and Harry just wasn't Harry. I ended up rolling with that and just treated the play like it was an extension of the movies. But a lot of the dialogue still felt less like what the characters (or anyone) would actually say and more like some canned line set up to get a laugh out of the audience. Even Moaning Myrtle seemed completely out of character.But can I please gush about Draco and Scorpius Malfoy for one moment? They TOTALLY stole the show here. Scorpius is a straight up adorable geek who's more of a follower than a leader (according to his father). And Draco's character was by far the most realistic out of any of the adults. I LOVED seeing his reflections on how the trio's fame impacted everyone's future -- his character alone strengthened this entire story so, so much. I just wanted to see the characters I knew and be able to connect with something, so that was nice. This scene right here was my favorite:(view spoiler)[DRACO: I always envied them, you know - Weasley and Granger. I had -GINNY: Crabbe and Goyle.DRACO: Two lunks who wouldn't know one one end of a broomstick from another. You - the three of you - you shone, you know? You liked each other. You had fun. I envied you those friendships more than anything else.GINNY: I envied them too.HARRY: I need to protect [Albus]-DRACO: My father thought he was protecting me. Most of the time. I think you have to make a choice - at a certain point - of the man you want to be. And I tell you that at that time you need a parent or a friend. And if you've learnt to hate your parent by then and you have no friends... then you're all alone. And being alone - that's so hard. I was alone. And it sent me to a truly dark place. For a long time. Tom Riddle was also a lonely child. You may not understand that, Harry, but I do - and I think Ginny does too.GINNY: He's right.DRACO: Tom Riddle didn't emerge from his dark place. And so Tom Riddle became Lord Voldemort.\n(hide spoiler)]And I did enjoy how the story managed to give more explanation from Dumbledore in defense of his actions (via a talking painting), *attempted* to give Snape a stronger character, and basically addressed a lot of fan's questions or criticism throughout the years.In the end I was expecting to say that no matter what happened it was fun to just see this world and new characters, but\u2026 I\u2019m really not sure. It felt more like really bad, messy fanfiction? It\u2019s like the end of Deathly Hallows should now be revised to the scar had not pained Harry for nineteen years. All was well.* This play is some footnote to clarify that NOW it\u2019s well and all of that trouble really is gone\u2026 which is silly because that story is done. Leave it be. They could have done literally anything else here besides drag everyone and their kids back through the highlights of the movies. I'm not convinced JK Rowling had much to do with this plot."}, {"Review": "3 1/2 stars. I completely get why many HP fans will be disappointed with this, but I have to admit: I really enjoyed it. I'd love to see this story play out on stage.So yeah, I understand the sad feelings. Harry Potter and the Cursed Child has a completely different vibe. Aside from being a play, it's also a more mature, character-driven, less magical story. It does not feel like an eighth Harry Potter book at all; there's a real disconnect between this play and the other seven novels. And you know what? I'm so glad. I guess it's just what you're hoping for. To be honest, I never wanted another Harry Potter book. The thought of extending a series I loved so much actually made me NOT want to read this. I got to the end of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows and thought it was magical perfection - the story had completed its arc in full and I put it aside feeling a slight melancholy, but a whole lot of satisfaction. I didn't want more.However, if you went crazy needing more from the HP series, you'll probably be disappointed by this. If you feel there's a gap where something HP is missing, then I don't think this will fill it. Separate the two in your mind, and you have a better chance of liking it. Because this is something different - and I'm happy about it.First, of course, it's a play. Right away it's going to be something unlike what we've seen before. I don't usually love to read plays, especially modern ones, but this one is very readable because the dialogue is wonderful. I don't know why people are saying \"it's so obvious JKR didn't write most of this\" because I think her style is all over it - the very fact that this play (which is meant to be viewed on stage) can be just as easily read like a book tells me JKR had a lot of input.Also, it's funny. Much more consistently comical than the books, but with the same style of humour - i.e. lots of Ron being a buffoon. \nHermione: If some part of Voldemort survived, in whatever form, we need to be prepared. And I\u2019m scared.Ginny: I\u2019m scared too.Ron: Nothing scares me. Apart from Mum.\nThe plot leaves a little something to be desired. Again, it feels different from the main series. It's not so much about the world and magic, but more about relationships, conflicts (particularly between Harry and Albus) and the dialogue between characters. I suppose this makes more sense in a play, where the story unravels through dialogue and not through an omniscient narrator.And, as I touched upon earlier, it feels... older. I don't know how well kids will appreciate the jokes about growing old and how Ron now says \"oof\" every time he sits down. Or the family drama between Harry and his son, Albus. But I liked it. I'm happy with this addition. I truly am. If it had been too similar to the seven novels, I feel it would have risked reopening a series that had been closed in a great place. Instead, we have something very unique and, for me, very entertaining. Some of the staging directions also leave me excited about seeing the play (when I win the lottery or acquire a magic wand, maybe).One thing I have to say that I said in another comment thread: NOW, it's time to stop. This was a risky experiment and it turned out to be fun, but JKR needs to leave this world alone now. I really do not want to read about old-age Harry, Ron and Hermione rolling around in magical wheelchairs. So, just stop.Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube | Store"}, {"Review": "It was alright. It was just alright.I know I gave this 4 stars, but to be honest, J.K. Rowling can write a dictionary with Harry Potter illustrations and I'd probably give it 4 stars, so my rating is almost irrelevant here, given my extreme bias.The thing is, it was cute, it was sweet, it was entirely nostalgic to see the old crew again, but I hated the play format. As a person who grew up with Harry Potter, and who is in her early 30s now, I feel like I grew up with Harry Potter and the crew, and with the advent of this book, I have, in fact, grown old with them. It was lovely to see them again. It was like meeting old friends.I don't feel old. I'm a more responsible person, for sure, but I feel young at heart. When we're young, adulthood, responsibilities, just the prospect of adulting seem so daunting...then one gets there and it's like, well, I'm as immature as I ever was. I love fun as much as I ever did. Growing old isn't that bad. And seeing the old crew being as much as they ever were brings joy into my not-yet-old-and-grizzled-heart.I could do without the kids, to be honest. Oh, sure, they're little Potter and Granger-Weasley spawns, but come on, nobody ever has and nobody ever will win me over as much as their parents, whom I have loved the instant we met them on the Hogwarts Express.(Ok, maybe not Ron...)But I digress. The kids aren't all bad. I rather like little Scorpius, actually.\nSCORPIUS: And it\u2019s just like my father\u2019s! I got his nose, his hair, and his name. Not that that\u2019s a great thing either. I mean \u2014 father-son issues, I have them. But, on the whole, I\u2019d rather be a Malfoy than, you know, the son of the Dark Lord.\nThe adults have grown, they've changed. Some have changed so much that I hardly recognize them, Draco, for instance. I like that he's, well, nicer now, but he doesn't feel like Draco, you know? I've been so used to Harry and Draco doing this...That it's rather discombobulating to see anything otherwise.But yeah, characters are great, but the format. THE FORMAT. I don't even know it's fair of me to judge this based on the fact that I don't like that it's a play, because for fuck's sakes, IT'S A PLAY. Like, what did I expect? This may be the most confusing review I've ever written. I just don't like the play format. It's meant for the stage. That means it's up to the skill of the actors to portray what is implied. It's up to the audience to interpret nuances. It is almost entirely based on dialogue, and I hate that. I miss Rowling's writing. I love Rowling's writing, and I wanted more of it. The play brings up so many things that could have been written so much more, had it been expanded into a book format. The children's growing pains, particular that of young Albus. Harry's feelings as a parent. Draco's struggles with who he was and who he is. Furthermore, Ron is relegated to little more than comic relief. Let's be honest, I never liked the guy, but for him to be much of the same character that he ever was conjures up the image of the try-hard middle-aged dude, and I know that Ron is more than that.I like it? I don't like it? I don't know. But I would certainly relish watching it on the stage if I ever had the chance. It's bound to be better than on paper."}, {"Review": "You know, I really hadn\u2019t foreseen the publication of something to lengthen Harry Potter\u2019s story after the conclusion that was Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. So, the way I see it, Harry Potter and the Cursed Child is a lovely gift to every Harry Potter fan out there who has hoped and waited a long time to see their wizard friends again.Though the plot holes are very visible and spread throughout the story, they make for charming and heartfelt conversations between characters, so I didn\u2019t mind them all that much.The best thing about this #8 Harry Potter is how nostalgic it makes the reader feel. There are plenty of familiar faces \u2013 Harry, Ginny, Draco, Hermione, Ron, Dumbledore, etc \u2013 as well as some interesting new ones \u2013 Albus, Rose, Scorpius, Lily, James\u2026Admittedly, it was strange to read this supposedly 8th story in Harry Potter\u2019s world in play format but the truth is, it was extremely easy to imagine everything play out like in a movie, so it all felt alive to me.This isn\u2019t a book you have to read but, if you\u2019re a diehard Harry Potter fan, I am going to look at you quite incredulously if you decide not to. I\u2019m sadly not going to be able to tell you that you're making the right choice, because this is so, so charming and fun, but I can understand people wanting to have their own vision of the Harry Potter cast as adults and their children. Yes, it's a bit silly but\u2026 I loved it still.Blog | Youtube | Twitter | Instagram | Google+ | Bloglovin\u2019"}, {"Review": "Now this was a real shame. It read like some juvenile fan fiction. The characters were utterly lifeless. Perhaps seeing this would be better. The stage actor\u2019s performances would carry the emotion and drama the dialogue completely failed to convey.The stage directions were also minimalistic. I mean we have a basic location set for us, but that\u2019s about all. There\u2019s no real expression or sense of urgency. All in all, it\u2019s just a little flat. The plot is feasible, even if it felt a little forced, but the characters were just poor. The new ones aren\u2019t so bad, but the old characters, Harry, Ron and Hermione, were barely themselves. They just had no depth to them; they\u2019re like reflections of their surface level. Ron felt like a piece of furniture that seemed to enjoy inserting several badly times jokes. Hermione seemed cold. And Harry, Harry simply isn\u2019t Harry. How can he identify himself as a bad farther? How can he believe that he had no farther figure in his own life? He had many. He had inspiration from many great men. They taught him a great deal about life and himself in the process. So why would a man who has defeated the face of evil be so daunted by giving his son some simple advice? It doesn\u2019t add up. Harry Potter would make an excellent farther. This didn\u2019t even feel like the same world.FBR | Twitter | Facebook | Insta | Academia"}, {"Review": "Update:+1 star for (view spoiler)[Scorpius Malfoy, the precious angel child that I didn't expect to love so much (hide spoiler)]-1 star for (view spoiler)[the trolley witch...I mean, are you kidding me?

Reading this really felt like Harry Potter fan-fiction to me, partly because it's hard to wrap my head around an 8th (sort of) Harry Potter story and partly because reading it as a play instead of a novel just made it feel...less like Harry Potter. I didn't dislike it; I definitely didn't love it--but I do want to be fair and say that reading a play is never, never as good as seeing the live production. In theory maybe this book shouldn't exist because it won't ever do the story justice. However, I'm glad I got to read it because I don't think I'll ever get to London to see the real deal, and at least now I know what it's all about."}, {"Review": "\"Hogwarts is a big place.\"\"Big.

Ron was reduced to being the butt of the joke. Not cool.3. Voldemort fucked Bellatrix and they had a child? By Merlin's Beard, I have so much to say about this that I better keep my mouth shut.4. Everyone called Voldemort Voldemort. Never ever would a former or proper Death Eater do that!5. Draco confiding his deepest feelings about Scorpius and Astoria in Harry. Parentage may change people, but the two of them will (at least in my head) never give each other emotional and heartfelt support, they have way too much history.6. Harry's anger at Dumbledore. We've had this in book 7. And we saw it resolve in book 7. I mean, dead Harry met dead Dumbledore and they had the most enlightening of conversations. And more than 20 years later Harry gets mad at a portrait? Nah.7. Where in seven hells are Hugo Weasley and Teddy Lupin. !?!8. Albus KISSING AND FLIRTING with his AUNT is a big huge no go. Disgusting.9. Basically how uncreative John Tiffany was. It made everything so predictable. J. K. Rowling would have given us new characters and creatures and a whole new plot. But this was like putting on second-hand Hogwarts robes and finding some dead Flubberworms in their pockets.  (hide spoiler)]The play though. It exceeded expectations. Actually, it was outstanding. So GOOD even after everything that disappointed me in the book. Just jaw-droppingly mind-blowing on every scale there is.

Overall we have an amazing cast.But then you get a whole theatre covered in magical ink and runes, you get freakishly scary Dementors flying over your head and transporting people through the air. Actually, there is a lot of flying. Then you get wand fights and flames and a beautiful fiery Patronus moving through the darkness. Scenes from under the lake with Albus and Scorpius \"swimming\" through the air, a moving maze and the famous moving stairs in Hogwarts. So many special and visual effects. You'll gasp and shiver and won't find words that describe what you feel.  (hide spoiler)]One of the most amazing things is that the actors actually took their time to sign loads and loads of books and photographs after the play (apart from Harry that is). They're all friendly and fun and just super nice.(And call me dead cause living and breathing Helena Bonham Carter and Bonnie Wright did that living and breathing thing just an armlength away from me. Sincerely, me, dead.)In a nutshell: This play is supposed to be watched and not read. Therefore I'll give it 5 stars. This was the ultimate Potter experience and I'm the happiest and luckiest person on earth. Everyone should be able to see it. ______Update 04/07/2016: THAT PLAY THAT WICKED PLAY KILLED ME.

Harry Potter and the Cursed Child continues the wondrous magical world that we all know and love.The story starts out at King's Cross with the original trio preparing their school-age children to board the train to start their first year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.It's at this time that Harry and his son, Albus, share a nice father-son moment:\u201cAlbus: Dad . . .Do you think \u2014 what if I am \u2014 what if I\u2019m put in Slytherin . . .Harry: And what would be wrong with that?Albus: Slytherin is the House of the snake, of Dark Magic . . . It\u2019s not a House of brave wizards.Harry: Albus Severus, you were named after two headmasters of Hogwarts. One of them was a Slytherin and he was probably the bravest man I ever knew.\u201d(I dislike Snape, but the overall conversation made me tear up a bit.)I also really appreciated that they talked about Slytherin in a positive light.We have a few time jumps here and there, and then complications arise because Harry - Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement - seized an illegal Time-Turner from Theodore Nott and has kept it.\u201cThe once-great Harry Potter, now a stone-cold Ministry man.\u201dMeanwhile, Albus gets sorted into Slytherin and struggles with the weight of a family legacy he never wanted.Harry tries to reach out to Albus but finds that he has diffuclity understanding someone different. And their connection wobbles from year to year because of it.\u201cHarry: Do you want a hand? Packing. I always loved packing. It meant I was leaving Privet Drive and going back to Hogwarts. Which was . . . well, I know you don\u2019t love it but . . .Albus: For you, it\u2019s the greatest place on earth. I know. The poor orphan, bullied by his uncle and aunt Dursley . . .Harry: Albus, please \u2014 can we just \u2014Albus: . . . traumatized by his cousin, Dudley, saved by Hogwarts. I know it all, Dad. Blah, blah, blah.Harry: I\u2019m not going to rise to your bait, Albus Potter.Albus: The poor orphan who went on to save us all. So may I say \u2014 on behalf of wizarding kind \u2014 how grateful we are for your heroism. Should we bow now or will a curtsy do?Harry: Albus, please \u2014 you know, I\u2019ve never wanted gratitude.Albus: But right now I\u2019m overflowing with it \u2014 it must be the kind gift of this moldy blanket that did it . . .Harry: Moldy blanket?Albus: What did you think would happen? We\u2019d hug. I\u2019d tell you I always loved you. What? What?Harry (finally losing his temper): You know what? I\u2019m done with being made responsible for your unhappiness. At least you\u2019ve got a dad. Because I didn\u2019t, okay?Albus: And you think that was unlucky? I don\u2019t.Harry: You wish me dead?Albus: No! I just wish you weren\u2019t my dad.\u201dHarry and Albus are trying to reach each other here, both are failing.As past and present fuse ominously, both father and son learn the uncomfortable truth: sometimes darkness comes from unexpected places.The Cursed Child answered a lot of topics that had been left unanswered in my mind, and it makes my heart tighten just thinking about everything.\u201cHarry: And I\u2019ve locked away the map. You won\u2019t see it again. Your mum left your room exactly as it was when you ran away \u2014 you know that? Wouldn\u2019t let me go in \u2014 wouldn\u2019t let anyone go in \u2014 you really scared her . . . And me.Albus: Really scared you?Harry: Yes.Albus: I thought Harry Potter wasn\u2019t afraid of anything?Harry: Is that how I make you feel?Albus looks at his dad, trying to figure him out.ALBUS: I don\u2019t think Scorpius said, but when we returned after failing to fix the first task, I was suddenly in Gryffindor House. Nothing was better between us then either \u2014 so \u2014 the fact that I\u2019m in Slytherin \u2014 that\u2019s not the reason for our problems. It\u2019s not just about that.\u201dI really appreciated that their relationship was developed in a very honest and raw way.And not only theirs, but the development of Draco and his son, Scorpius, was truly melting my everything.\u201cDraco: Astoria always knew that she was not destined for old age. She wanted me to have somebody when she left, because . . . it is exceptionally lonely, being Draco Malfoy. I never realized, though, that by hiding him away from this gossiping, judgmental world, I ensured that my son would emerge shrouded in worse suspicion than I ever endured.Harry: Love blinds. We have both tried to give our sons, not what they needed, but what we needed. We\u2019ve been so busy trying to rewrite our own pasts, we\u2019ve blighted their present.\u201dWatching Draco care deeply and fiercely for his child made me open up my heart.Oh, and I wanted to mention how ecstatic I was when Albus befriended a Malfoy. Their friendship was inspiring until the very last heartbreaking page.\u201cScorpius: Your dad thinks the rumors are true \u2014 I am the son of Voldemort?Albus (nods): His department are currently investigating it.Scorpius: Good. Let them. Sometimes \u2014 sometimes I find myself thinking \u2014 maybe they\u2019re true too.Albus: No. They\u2019re not true. And I\u2019ll tell you why. Because I don\u2019t think Voldemort is capable of having a kind son \u2014 and you\u2019re kind, Scorpius. To the depths of your belly, to the tips of your fingers. I truly believe Voldemort \u2014 Voldemort couldn\u2019t have a child like you.Scorpius: That\u2019s nice \u2014 that\u2019s a nice thing to say.Albus: And it\u2019s something I should have said a long time ago. In fact, you\u2019re probably the best person I know. And you don\u2019t \u2014 you couldn\u2019t \u2014 hold me back. You make me stronger \u2014 and when Dad forced us apart \u2014 without you \u2014Scorpius: I didn\u2019t much like my life without you in it either.\"We also had a lot of unexpected returns from the people that ended up sacrificing themselves in previous books, which truly broke me\u2014 I kept looking for Fred Weasley to show up and crack a joke... but, alas, you can't always get what you want.But to end this review on a more positive note, I want to mention my favorites: Hermione and Ron.\u201cRon: I mean, we\u2019ve been together so long \u2014 and married for so long \u2014 I mean, so long \u2014Hermione: If this is your way of saying you want a marital break, Ron, then, to be clear, I will skewer you with this quill.Ron: Shut up. Will you shut up for once? I want to do one of those marriage renewal things I\u2019ve read about. Marriage renewal. What do you think?Hermione (melting slightly): You want to marry me again?Ron: Well, we were only young when we did it the first time and I got very drunk and \u2014 well, to be honest, I can\u2019t remember much of it and . . . The truth is \u2014 I love you, Hermione Granger, and whatever time says \u2014 I\u2019d like the opportunity to say so in front of lots of other people. Again. Sober.She looks at him, she smiles, she pulls him to her, she kisses him.Hermione: You\u2019re sweet.Ron: And you taste of toffee . . .\u201dI'm always up for more canon Romione.To sum up, I thought at first that the format of the story would interfere with getting completely pulled in, but I needn't have worried\u2014 this book was the definition of unputdownable. It truly didn't take long for me to realize how much I missed reading about Harry Potter and his magical surroundings. Hogwarts will always be like home. And now... I'm getting tearful just thinking about what an impact it made on me, as both the reader and person I am today.Also, it was pretty nice getting to know that both Harry Potter and I are afraid of pigeons:\u201cHarry: You told me you don\u2019t think I\u2019m scared of anything, and that \u2014 I mean, I\u2019m scared of everything. I mean, I\u2019m afraid of the dark, did you know that?Albus: Harry Potter is afraid of the dark?Harry: I don\u2019t like small spaces and \u2014 I\u2019ve never told anyone this, but I don\u2019t much like \u2014 (he hesitates before saying it) pigeons.Albus: You don\u2019t like pigeons?Harry (he scrunches up his face): Nasty, pecky, dirty things. They give me the creeps.\u201dYes, Harry!!Oh, and my favorite acts were acts 2 & 4\u2014 because family dynamics and mystery!!Just... I'm so glad this book exists, I truly missed my favorite trio.5/5 stars (of course)*Note: I'm an Amazon Affiliate.

The Blind Zealot.This type of fan will forgive an author almost anything. Inconsistent behavior in main characters, enormous plot holes, unexplained developments, etc., it doesn't matter, b/c OHMAGAWD, I LOVE IT SO MUCH!!! *squeeeeeeee*2. The Thoughtful, Critical Reader.This type of fan loves a series based solely on its merit. They aren't blind to the aforementioned plot holes or inconsistent characters, they are in fact disappointed by such occurrences, but they can still maintain LOVE for the overall series. For example, I LOVE HARRY POTTER, but I did not love HARRY POTTER AND THE ORDER OF THE PHOENIX, b/c I felt Rowling encapsulated all the teenangsty emotions of adolescence a little bit too thoroughly. It was, in a word, exhausting.PLOT TWIST: I think both types of fans are equally likely to have issues with this latest addition to their Harry Potter library.Blind Zealots:The trouble with ending a series is that if it's done well, you have all the answers to all of your questions, and a vague enough HEA-type scenario that your well-loved cast of characters is assured whatever it is that they deserve. Heroines and Heroes live happily ever after, Villains and Minions are thwarted and punished, and while you aren't foolish enough to think everyone's adventures are over, Good continuing to triumph over Evil is reasonably guaranteed. BUT.Once you've finished something, the only way to reopen it is too create new conflict--without conflict there's no story. Suddenly the nebulous \"HEA\" isn't so nebulous, and that new clarity jeopardizes everything you've happily assumed about what comes next.Harry, Ginny, Hermione, and Ron, previously cardboard cutouts of adult wizards, become real parents with real children, and those children must grow up, making mistakes while they do it, and, worse, they must go through puberty and all the angst that entails.That's not happily ever after . . . That's REAL LIFE. Then Real Life takes your daydream of a-son-of-Harry-Potter being sorted into Slytherin and reinventing the house's image with the kind of unaffected rebelliousness you associated with a teenaged Sirius Black, and crushes it under its heel, forcing you to realize that wizards . . . are kind of assholes.So now, adding insult to injury, the image of the utopian magical society that sprang fully formed from Voldemort's ashes is forever ruined.A Blind Zealot might find ignorance preferable to that turn of events.But those aren't my issues. My issues are thus:1. I HATE TIME TRAVEL.I've said it before, and I'll say it again: I'm an escapist reader. I need to be consumed by a book to fully enjoy it, and that means I NEED to be able to believe what I'm reading is the truth.BUT.Time travel destroys the possibility of believing anything, b/c it's ALL subject to change. Why mourn a character's death if it will more than likely be nullified in the next chapter or two? Why dredge up any outrage on a character's behalf when the object of her torment will be thwarted during the second take?For me, it's not an issue of, \"why would I?\" It's an issue of, \"I can't.\" And if I can't feel anything in response to your characters or your story, why would I read your book?2. Resurrecting Voldemort-as-villain is lazy. And infuriating.We survived three of Voldemort's failed attempts at rebirth, we survived one success, and we survived a three book revelation that essentially said we had to kill him SEVEN TIMES for his death to actually stick.After all of that, how could anyone think it would be a Good Idea to bring him back AGAIN?Admittedly, it wasn't quite that simple, but . . . it was also exactly that simple. Everything and everyone else connected to ye olde grande scheme was superfluous, merely the means of achieving a so-very-tired end.As for the aforementioned superfluous detail: (view spoiler)[I recognize the futility of relying on Bellatrix LeStrange's marital status as an argument against her conceiving Voldemort's child. That crazy bitch was probably so euphoric at the idea of giving birth to her Master's spawn that she felt no pain during the actual delivery.BUT.No matter how much he wished it, Voldemort wasn't actually a god, so divine conception was an impossibility . . . Which means . . . He would have had to . . . Physically . . . Have . . . Sex . . . In order to produce offspring.O______OI don't think Bellatrix would've objected to the necessity--we've already established that she's a CRAZY BITCH.BUT . . . I'm not convinced he was physically able:A. At the alleged time of procreation, he was more snake than man. B. Snakes don't have noses, neither did Voldemort.C. Snakes don't have . . . do-NOT-make-me-say-it-you-know-where-this-is-going.That's all I'm sayin'. *shrugs awkwardly*  (hide spoiler)]3. Unnecessary drama.At first I debated whether or not it was fair to fault a staged production for being overly dramatic, but I hate unnecessary drama on the screen as much as I hate it on paper, so, YES, it most definitely is fair.A. Stop crying, dammit. Especially you, Harry. *rolls eyes*B. Ginny's instant escalation from concerned-but-understanding wife into finger-pointing harridan. If you've read it, you know to what I'm referring.C. Harry's impersonation of a father-as-dictator (view spoiler)[that I initially attributed to the first timeturning, but as he had his come-to-Jesus before the timeline was altered again, I'm forced to conclude was simply his epically poor parenting skills. (hide spoiler)]4. Contradictions, including, but not limited to:In Act 2, when Harry uses his conversation with Dumbledore-as-portrait as reasoning for his ludicrous request, Headmistress McGonagoll admonishes him for treating a \"memoir\" like the actual person:\nHARRY: And Dumbledore\u2014Dumbledore said\u2014PROFESSOR McGONAGALL: What? HARRY: His portrait. We spoke. He said some things which made sense\u2014PROFESSOR McGONAGALL: Dumbledore is dead, Harry. And I\u2019ve told you before, portraits don\u2019t represent even half of their subjects.\nBUT, in Act 4, this:DUMBLEDORE (openly weeping now): I was blind. That is what love does. I couldn\u2019t see that you needed to hear that this closed-up, tricky, dangerous old man . . . loved you. A pause. The two men are overcome with emotion.\nEither they're two men or they're one man and a flawed copy. Pick one and stick with it, please.5. Plot holes.A. If Dolores Umbrage warded her Hogwarts office against unauthorized entry, do you really expect me to believe that (view spoiler)[Hermione wouldn't similarly ward the office of the MINISTER OF MAGIC? (hide spoiler)]B. How many times have we heard some variation of, \"Am I the only person who's read Hogwarts, a History?\"And how many of those times were specifically in reference to wards that prevented witches and wizards from magicking themselves onto Hogwarts' property? Yet suddenly and inexplicably, anyone can use the floo network to travel to any number of chimneys on the grounds.C. There was also some nonsense about Albus and Scorpius not needing to worry about a certain de-wanded Hogwarts student being harmed b/c \"the professors would never allow serious injury to occur,\" which is, simply put . . . laughable.That's not to say HARRY POTTER AND THE CURSED CHILD was horrible and I hated it. It wasn't and I didn't. I even loved parts of it, Scorpius in particular. BUT. Even taking into consideration that it was a script, not a novel, it wasn't the same level of quality we've come to expect from Rowling (who, no, may not have written the thing in its entirety, but who, YES, did collaborate on and ultimately give her seal of approval for), and that is disappointing. I'm not going to bother recommending or not recommending this one--you'll either read it or you won't, and at this stage of series worship or indifference, your decision will have little to do with what I have to say about it. SO. Go forth and do what you were always going to do."}, {"Review": "It's finally HERE!!! HP FOR LIFE!!My post on Hello Beautiful Book BlogWHO'S EXCITED?!?OMGGGGGGGIt's going to be published on HARRY'S BIRTHDAY!!!! OH HAPPY DAYYYYFROM TIME MAGAZINE ONLINE:\n\"There\u2019s good news for Harry Potter fans who won\u2019t be able to make it to London to see the theatrical production of Harry Potter and the Cursed Child: the play will be published in book form immediately after its debut.The script, written by Jack Thorne and based on a story by J.K. Rowling, Thorne and John Tiffany, will be published as an eBook by Pottermore, Rowling\u2019s digital publishing platform, and in hardcover by Scholastic in the U.S. The first printing will be a \u201cSpecial Rehearsal Edition,\u201d reflecting the script from the early part of the preview period, and a later \u201cDefinitive Collector\u2019s Edition\u201d will present the finalized version (as many plays make small changes during previews).The story picks up 19 years after the end of the original series, with Potter working at the Ministry of Magic, now a father of three. As Pottermore describes, \u201cWhile Harry grapples with a past that refuses to stay where it belongs, his youngest son Albus must struggle with the weight of a family legacy he never wanted.\u201dThe play premieres on July 30, and the book will be released July 31, which just so happens to be The Chosen One\u2019s birthday.\"\n"}, {"Review": "\nCONGRATS TO HARRY POTTER AND THE CURSED CHILD FOR WINNING THE 2016 GOODREADS CHOICE AWARDS FOR BEST FANTASY!!!\nBloody Hell!I freaking cried. I was afraid I wasn't going to like this book but I did and I damn cried. This is a SPOILER FREE review so I can't tell you what made me cry. Even though this is about the kids and all of our loves are older, they wrote the book in a way that we get to have some memories of certain things. And my favorite character made me cry again! I really hope they put this play out on dvd sometime and make it available to everyone. Although, it might be weird seeing other people playing the parts. Anyway, I loved reading about the children. I loved the friendship between Albus, Harry's son and Scorpius, Draco's son. Scorpius was the sweetest one of all, who would have thunk. I didn't like some of the parts Ron played, he seemed like an idiot but he's Ron and I love Ron. Of course most of you already know it's written in a play format. This was weird at first and then I got into it. I don't think I have ever read a play before, it seems like I would remember. This was a nice little trip down Hogwarts Lane and the little mystery/hijinks the kids get up to that brings on all kinds of issues was a cool edition. Well, not really, but you know what I mean. I loved it. I can't say that I loved everything about it and I might not have loved it if that one part didn't come into play, but who cares. I am so happy with it for what it is.

But it's also about Father/Son relation very well written..I loved how it goes, from wrong to kinda right.Between Harry and Albus, Between Dumbledore and Harry\u2026And even between Draco and Scorpius..Also the Marital relation is really good here\u2026I loved Ron and Hermione their opposite character yet their strong bond.And the love that lived...between Harry and Ginny.Oh and Draco and his wife\u2026Okay, time for,The Characters-----------Again... Rowling is really cruel to her characters here..Harry's being a \"Hot Head\" is clearly deepening the problem with his son.. he's always has been a hot head by the way..yet Ginny is a good mother, and better wife than I expected.Hermone was good , not excellent but I LOVED how she turned into two different characters .. one was really awesome in the Dystopia, the second was really bad...but that may match what happened.I just may be didn't like Ron much that I didn't feel angry enough for him being a bit shallow in this play but that still a bit sad.And I have to admit that I really LOVE how Draco is...with his still being have the trace of what he was before...BUT don't forget it's not about Harry Potter anymore...it's more about the Kids...Though I wished to see more of Rose who's been shallow but I just loved Albus and Scorpios..You'll be surprised with who you're gonna meet here.. truly.Some of the Characters we all love makes appearance, some of them even you may never expect to see again!!!! I have to say that I felt goosebumps everytime an old character appears...not just flashbacks, some was in The Future Past, or a real dystopia, some in dreams, even in portraits and some are just mentioned.I really loved it.

Rowling announced that that's it for Harry Potter stories\u2026 it is the the full circle\u2026 the Beginning meets the End..the time has answered every What-if we can think of.What if we use the time Turner to...It's all here.19 Years for most of us, since the release of Harry Potter and the Philosopher\u2019s Stone in 1997...Reading the story of Harry and his friends in 7 Volumes..Reading as many lines about the back story of them and the rest of characters in the Pottermore and social media by Rowling. Craving for one more time with them...after the Epilogue that passed 19 years.Get excited with the very short article 2 years ago on Dumbledore Army reunited in the Qudditch World Cup.Now here it is, a full story, one last story full of love and nostalgia.We can't go back in time. We shan't dwell in the past..And when I finish it, 2 times, I really admit This is EVERYTHING I've ever wanted in a Harry Potter sequels but I just wish a Time Turner, back to 1997 and start reading Harry Potter all over again.... :)It's not good to dwell in past anyway, so I'm just Happy I lived this series..grown up with it..I, and many of Potterheads and fans, were worried sick it may let us down but I'm so glad that many liked it.And it's bittersweet to know that's it.BUT We must have THE \u2018Definitive Edition\u2019 of the play that promised.The series of Harry Potter, the boy who lived,is now complete\u2026And we still have a Wizarding World so vast to explore.With J.K.

Seriamente, qualcuno avrebbe dovuto prenderlo a calci, un sacco di calci in culo un sacco di volte, magari si sarebbe fatto pi\u00f9 furbo.Per quel che riguarda Harry\u2026 No, io mi rifiuto di anche solo pensare che questo sia Harry. Quest\u2019uomo non ha nulla a che fare con il ragazzo di cui tutti, diciamocelo, ci siamo innamorati ad un certo punto. E non si pu\u00f2 nemmeno giustificare con \u201c\u00e8 diventato un uomo adulto\u201d perch\u00e9 qua si passa dal giorno alla notte, davvero.Nel complesso, comunque, un libro molto deludente, un libro che avremmo proprio potuto evitare di leggere.Spero davvero che la Rowling abbia solo messo il nome, senza nemmeno leggere il libro (anche se pure in quel caso ammetto mi dispiacerebbe sapere come ha venduto la sua creazione), perch\u00e9 non voglio crederci che lei abbia letto e accettato questa \u201croba\u201d.Before Reading:I've been waiting for this book for something like 10 years.or even better: for my whole life."}, {"Review": "FULL VIDEO REVIEW IS LIVE: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNTYG...I have a lot of mixed feelings on this book. Am I happy we got another Harry Potter story? Yes. Am I satisfied with some aspects? Absolutely. But am I disappointed as well? Unfortunately, YES.L I K E S :Characters:I was so happy to feel like the characters were authentic. Throughout the entire novel, these felt like the children I grew up alongside and their development over the last two decades into adults felt REAL. Everyone was who I wanted them to become (ESPECIALLY DRACO) and even the kid's had their own distinctive voices I really enjoyed. The dynamic of the characters (Harry & Draco are a perfect example, as well as Harry & Ginny and Ron & Hermione) were consistent with the books, yet still developed over the years into what I felt they should be. Also Scorpius is my everything, he is one of the purest characters in all of literature and if you disagree, bye.Things that were addressed that needed to be addressed:(view spoiler)[.FINALLY WE SEE HARRY SUFFERING FROM THE TRAUMA OF HIS CHILDHOOD. It bothered me to no end that in the books, the only remnants of his abuse were Harry being surprised when people were nice to him. Here, Harry is obviously suffering from flashbacks from life with the Dursley's and as much as I hate to see him in further pain, I've been wondering for years why this never came up before. Consider me satisfied.  (hide spoiler)](view spoiler)[ HARRY CONFRONTS DUMBLEDORE ABOUT KEEPING HIM THE DARK ABOUT ALL HE KNEW. Let me start off by saying I LOVE Albus Dumbledore. He made mistakes over the years in how he approached Harry/Voldemort and what not, but overall, I think he was a great man, a talented wizard, and had a good heart despite his questionable actions. That being said, Harry did gain more nerve over the years as he was growing up, and his mini-heated moments with Dumbledore never really did the situation justice in my opinion. I'm so happy Harry finally called Dumbledore out on how little information he shared with Harry and Dumbledore was forced to respond. I really really loved this scene and I'm so glad it finally happened.  (hide spoiler)]Minimal moments that made me happy: Basically, I think there are so many people that loved everything about this book, but as I read this book very critically and found a lot of faults, the parts I loved seemed pretty minimal so I've grouped them here.-Beginning: I loved that the story started at the epilogue of Deathly Hallows. I didn't even think this was a possibility, but I think it was the perfect way to mesh these two stories into one another.- Draco & Harry's Dynamic: These two developed exactly as I wanted them to. While there is still an air of distaste around both of them, they've truly grown and come to terms with each other. (view spoiler)[ We have classic Draco/Harry like the duel in Harry's kitchen, the fact that Draco still refers to Harry as Potter, and especially that wonderful line \"Keep up old man.\" \"Draco, we're the same age. \"Well, I wear it better.\" But we also have beautiful moments like when Draco admits he was always jealous of The Golden Trio or really opens up to Harry about Astoria & wanting to protect Scorpius. It was truly one of my favorite relationships in the book and I'm ecstatic it turned out the way I wanted it to.  (hide spoiler)]-(view spoiler)[ The transition of the timeline changing was done REEAAAALLLY well. When Harry tells Albus he has to spend all of his time in the Gryffindor common room and claims \"he knows what house he is\", I was truly confused being like \"Harry Potter are you even trying to change the housing system? You're not THAT famous.\" but I very quickly realized it was the timeline slowing changing everyone but Albus/Scorpius and I thought it was a clever way to set up for the next scene of UTTER CHAOS.  (hide spoiler)]-(view spoiler)[ Albus's idea to write a message to Harry in demiguise to react with the love potion he spilled on Harry's blanket was BRILLIANT in my opinion. While I'm still questioning how they got a hold of the blanket so easily without Lily knowing, it was a very classic HP Solution moment to me, and I was super satisfied.  (hide spoiler)]Humor: I personally really enjoyed the humor in the play! The jokes coming from the cast felt really true to their characters and this book had me laughing out loud all throughout the books. I'll go over specific lines in my video review for the sake of length on here, but I don't think there was a single intentional joke that didn't have me howling of laughter.Scorpius & Albus: Okay listen, I am one to respect anyone's sexuality, so if these two claim they're straight, they're straight. But seriously, there is so much queer baiting in this script that it pains me to know it was never going to amount to anything. I don't understand why it's so bad to have two gay wizards as the main characters. If you're going to throw lines at me like \"He doesn't like his friend talking to a girl\" and \"They hug each other with fierceness. They hold for a beat.\" IMMA SHIP THEM TOGETHER. And that's not to undermine their love as friends; regardless of their sexuality, they have a beautiful relationship and their dynamic is a pleasure to read. It's clear they love each other so much, even if it is just as friends. I just think I would have loved this story on a whole 'nother level if their friendship became something more at the end of the story.D I S L I K E S :Lack of characters: This goes into my feeling that this plot was FAR TOO LARGE to be limited to the time constraints and physical space on the stage for a play. There is an absence of every character who is not Harry, Ginny, Ron, Hermione, Draco, Albus, Scorpius,and Delphi. -Hugo: Does not appear ONCE. What REALLY confuses me and goes into the contradiction to the books, is that he was at Kings Cross in the Deathly Hallows epilogue, yet he's not in the first scene. He starts Hogwarts during Albus/Scorpius/Rose's third year, yet he. is. never. there. He's Ron and Hermione's child for gods sake! He should have been in this book!- Rose, James, & Lily: While we do see these three in the beginning for a few scenes, all three are virtually absent from the entire play after about Act Two. How on earth do you expect me to believe these two groups of parents are off on another CRAZY adventure, but don't show any thought about their children, other than Albus? It's just unreasonable and does not make sense. I'm going to say this a million times throughout these reviews, but if you use the argument that \"it's a play, they don't have enough time,\" then they should not have made this story a play. Lack of room for a plot is the biggest reason to NOT include it and putting out something incomplete is just sloppy and amateur.- Neville: Neville is mentioned COUNTLESS times throughout this novel. He's a professor at Hogwarts and you bet your ass he would coddle The Golden Trio's children like they were his own, but again HE DOESN'T SHOW UP ONCE. (view spoiler)[ I mean the world literally \"rests of Neville Longbottom\" at on point, and we still don't see his as an active part of the play?  (hide spoiler)] I'm purely disappointed.- Teddy Lupin: Teddy is obviously a very minor character but HE WAS ALSO AT KINGS CROSS (which still confuses me because he had left Hogwarts at this point, but whatevs) HE WAS STILL THERE. They made a big deal that Teddy was a \"part of the Potter family\" and came over for dinner frequently, but he isn't even mentioned in the books. Also, his CHARACTER ITSELF was made a big deal by Jo, who wanted the story to end on another child being left an orphan. But nope, there's no space for anyone who wasn't a main character (which is a large fault in the author's planning because side characters are still hugely important to a story) so we don't see him at all.- Hagrid: OK WHERE THE HELL IS HAGRID. Someone suggested to me that he may have wrongfully passed, but if McGonagall is alive, I'm betting Hagrid's giant blood gives him a different lifespan than most wizards. HE WOULD LITERALLY DO ANYTHING TO SPEND TIME WITH HARRY&GINNY&RON&HERMIONE'S CHILDREN WHERE IS HE. We go through like three or four alternate timelines of Hogwarts and he is absent in all of them. Seriously, it's a straight up disservice to his character.Harry & Albus's relationship: (view spoiler)[ I really disliked how Albus treated his father. People are on here saying Harry is a terrible father, and all I can think is why none of them touch on how terrible of a son Albus was in the beginning. Albus is so angsty and resentful that his father is famous (most of which, he didn't chose to be famous for) and completely denies any effort Harry makes. Albus MOCKS HARRY OF HIS CHILDHOOD AND ABUSE. ARE YOU KIDDING ME?! He makes fun of Harry for being an orphan (not his fault) and being abused by the Dursley's (not his fault.) Yes, Harry's response was not okay either. But we have YEARS of Harry attempting to help Albus and connect with him that fall to pieces with one comment. We also have years of Albus treating Harry like shit. It took me a really long time to like Albus because of this, and I'm glad the ending implies that they are finally starting to connect with each other and build a better relationship, the beginning of this novel was painful to read because of it.  (hide spoiler)]The scene in the Ministry: okay I got a looooooot of issues here. 1. (view spoiler)[ Hermione, the goddamn Minister of Magic, would allow her office to be opened with a simple \"Alohomora\"? Preposterous.  (hide spoiler)]2. (view spoiler)[ THIS WHOLE BOOKCASE PLOT IS SO STUPID. Why on earth would she leave a trail of riddles leading to the time turner if A. No one but herself and select Ministry employees are meant to know about it. B. WHY WOULD THE RIDDLES ACTUALLY LEAD TO THE DAMN TIME TURNER!? In previous HP riddles (i.e. Sorcerer's Stone & Goblet of Fire), the riddles are meant to be tests to prove if you are worthy enough to move on. The riddles here are meant as \"protection\", yet it doesn't protect them at all, it literally leads anyone who could figure it out RIGHT TO WHAT SHE WAS HIDING. Hermione knows where she hid it, she wouldn't need to go through the same scavenger hunt over and over again when she wants to retrieve it. The protection should have made it IMPOSSIBLE for anyone unwanted to find it. I despise the idea that the brightest witch of her age and the most (politically) powerful witch in Britian would so poorly protect a highly dangerous and illegal object.  (hide spoiler)]THE TIME TURNERS:Oh lordy, lordy. Prepare for the longest rant of this entire review. 1. To give you a run down, the system of time travel established in Prisoner of Azkaban is essentially a \"fixed timeline\" meaning that the time traveler's actions would not alter the timeline at all. (ex. it's Harry who creates the Patronus to save himself & Sirius because as Harry himself claims \"It was easy, because I'd already done it.) In Harry Potter & The Cursed Child, it follows the timeline known as the \"Grandfather Paradox\" (aka used in Back to the Future) which is a COMPLETELY DIFFERENT SYSTEM OF TIME that is more flexible and allows people to change history by their actions. YOU. CAN'T. HAVE. TWO. DIFFERENT. SYSTEMS. OF. TIME. It's made clear that creating a paradox is possible in POA (an example given is that one can kill their future/past self if they are recognized by themselves), but that doesn't change that fact that there is no evidence of the fixed timeline that has been established for 12 years in TCC. Paradoxes fucking everywhere and The Doctor is sobbing from his Tardis.2. (view spoiler)[ It's stated in this book that the time turner Albus & Scorpius use DOES allow them to go back further than hours. (If you didn't know, time turners are virtually an encased HOUR reversal charm. Using a regular time turner, Albus, Scorpius, and Delphi would have had to turn the object over 200,000 times to go back to the TriWizard Tournament.) Since it's established that it's different, we are never told how it actually works? Do we still twist it back to choose how far we want? Is it a yearly-reversal charm now? (which also doesn't make sense, see point #3) You can't introduce an entirely new magical object without giving any explanation. If Prisoner of Azkaban can teach us about time turners in a 2 1/2 hour movie, The Cursed Child could explain how this new one works in a 3 hour play. There's literally no excuse for this gigantic piece of missing information. And again, if you think \"they didn't have enough time in the play to explain it,\" IT. SHOULD. NOT. BE. INCLUDED.  (hide spoiler)]3. (view spoiler)[ Since when do time turners allow you to pick the exact date & time you want to arrive in time at???????? They travel back to tasks #1 and #2 of the TriWizard tournament at LEAST twice over the course of MULTIPLE days, meaning they don't need to be on the exact date they want to travel 23 years back. They somehow have the ability to pick the DAY, YEAR, AND TIME they want to travel to with ZERO explanation. For a prototype, that's pretty extensive, and most likely, IMPOSSIBLE.  (hide spoiler)]4. On Pottermore, (here's an image as a source https://twitter.com/LIBassBunny/statu... - the original post I found it from is from 3 years ago) J.K. Rowling admits that she left a ton of plot holes in the system of time travel she created. She claims to have fixed that over the years, ending the solution with destroying all of them during the battle at the Department of Mysteries. And I think this is great, this is what authors should have the incentive to do when they make a mistake. BUT if she wanted to fix it, why would she approve a script that is built on the foundation of something she tried to erase in her books? It truly makes me question either how genuine her approval is, or the integrity of her character to turn her back on her previous decisions.To sum up, Harry Potter and the Cursed Child BUTCHERED the system of time & time travel created by Jo and I have no words to describe how detrimental this is to the plot.Big secret plot twist I don't want to spoil: (view spoiler)[ BELLATRIX WAS PREGNANT WITH VOLDEMORT'S CHILD, ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME?? THIS IS RIDICULOUS. 1. Not only is it upsetting to me because I always imagined Voldemort to be asexual in a sense because human emotions other than hatred, like love and happiness and lust always seemed so beneath him (Yes, lust is a human emotion, for the most part. Humans and other mammals are virtually the only species that have sex for pleasure and not strictly procreation.) So first of all, I'm amazed Voldemort having sex is even canon.  (hide spoiler)]2. (view spoiler)[ We see Bellatrix Lestrange throughout her pregnancy during the books, despite her never being pregnant???? I'm gonna assume here that wizard pregnancy is the same as muggle pregnancy and she would carry her child for 9 months. In Deathly Hallows, we see Belltrix at the beginning of the book (July 1997) at Malfoy Manor, and later we see her at Malfoy Manor after Harry breaks into Gringotts (May 1998). She is not pregnant in the books at either of these times. Yes, that's 11 months and she CONVENIENTLY could have brought her pregnancy to term within those 11 months we don't see her. But when something is this conveniently timed after the fact, it destroys all evidence to realism to me.  (hide spoiler)]3. (view spoiler)[ With the Malfoy Manor being basically Death Eater HQ at this time, I'd like to think Bellatrix spent a lot of time there surrounded by Death Eaters. ARE YOU TELLING ME NO ONE NOTICED SHE WAS FUCKING PREGNANT?! I guess we apparently now have a spell to reduce a baby bump or some other convenient explanation here.  (hide spoiler)]4. (view spoiler)[ To go along with #3, Draco LIVES at Malfoy Manor. Bellatrix was definitely there multiple times over the 11 months. Bellatrix is his aunt, whom I would assume he would see more than other Death Eaters considering she and her mother always seemed relatively close. Are you trying to tell me one of the main characters from this story would just \"happen\" to not see/forget his aunt's pregnancy happening in his own home, right under his nose?  (hide spoiler)]This is ridiculous. This is far too convenient. There is too little information on when this actually happened. I refuse to accept this as part of the plot.Random little things that bother me:- First trip back in time: (view spoiler)[ Albus asks if they're certain the dragon won't kill Cedric without his wand, Delphi replies \"This is Hogwarts. They won't let damage happen to any of the champions.\" YOU REALIZE YOU ARE THERE BECAUSE A BOY ACTUALLY DIED IN THIS COMPETITION AND YOU ARE TRYING TO CHANGE THAT. YOU ARE LITERALLY IN 1994 STANDING WHERE YOU ARE BECAUSE A CHAMPION DIED. LIKE WHO LET THIS LINE PASS THROUGH EDITING!?!?!  (hide spoiler)]-The Trolley Witch: (view spoiler)[ Okay serious what was this nonsense. Absolutely ridiculous. I have no idea who's executive decision this was, but it was terrible. This is the wizarding world. We could have had a much better and fitting obstacle to prevent Albus & Scorpius from jumping off the train. I couldn't even laugh at it's ridiculousness because I was cringing too hard.  (hide spoiler)]T H I N G S T H A T M A D E M E C R Y :-Harry in Godric's Hollow: (view spoiler)[ I have seen the deaths of Lily and James Potter quite a few times throughout the series, but nothing compares to the pain of watching Harry have to watch. As much as this hurt me, I think it was a wonderful addition to the play.  (hide spoiler)]-Hagrid meeting Harry for the first time: (view spoiler)[ \"My name is Rubeus Hagrid, and I'm going to be your friend whether you like it or not.\" Tears. No explanation neeed.  (hide spoiler)]-Draco opening up to Harry: (view spoiler)[ When Draco visits Harry at work and they talk about their sons, Astoria's death, and Draco's life, I was a mess. \"It is exceptionally lonely being Draco Malfoy\" hit me SOOO hard. I also love how much Draco loves Astoria and Scorpius. I just thought this scene was so deep and true and I'm forever grateful we got to see it.  (hide spoiler)]There are a million more things to say in my video review, so stay tuned for that on my YouTube channel. All in all, I'm happy we got this book. I'm happy I read it. I'm happy that some things stayed true and somethings impressed me. But I'm super disappointed that it's so dissociated from the rest of the books plot-wise and that it was very underdeveloped. I will stand by my opinion that this should have been a full novelization of the play, and that would have fixed a lot of the inconsistencies and plot holes. I will absolutely go to see this play when it hits New York, and I would recommend it to any Harry Potter fan."}, {"Review": "SPOILER FREE VIDEO REVIEW: https://youtu.be/WUFTFkyDHlY2.5* (I think)So here's the deal. I went into this being apprehensive. My expectations were low and I was right. I just felt like Harry Potter's story ended where it had to end. The questions that were left unanswered kept the story alive as I would imagine what might be going on in their lives as adults. This answers all those questions and then some. I wanted to rate this higher but I think 2.5 is as high as I can go. These characters didn't feel like the characters I fell in love with. The story had cringe worthy moments and honestly felt like fan fiction. I think seeing this actually performed would be incredible, but reading it was just, average. Might do a video review so I can go more into depth because I definitely have more to say."}, {"Review": "Spoiler free review!This review can also be found on my blog, Dana and the Books.I never thought I'd get to count down the days to another Harry Potter release.I was understandably hesitant about a sequel, but I'm relieved after having read it. It was everything I could have hoped for and\u00a0not at all what I was expecting - seriously, not\u00a0at all - but it was perfect. \u00a0It was the type of story I play within my head when I have too much time on my hands. I was super lucky to be able to go into the story completely spoiler free and it definitely enhanced the twists and just everything.I'm not going to comment on the plot or characters. I want others who wish\u00a0to go in blind like I did to have that\u00a0chance, and I don't want to be the one\u00a0who spoils it for them.Instead, I'm going to talk about feelings.I remember the sinking sensation\u00a0I had right after finishing\u00a0Deathly Hallows for the first time - though that was enhanced by a combination of no sleep (midnight release party) and also being an eighteen-year-old-girl who just had her emotions ripped out and then torn apart by the lovely Ms Rowling. It lasted for days. It was a unique experience\u00a0to have grown up with Harry and be just a year older than\u00a0him during the Battle of Hogwarts. The end of\u00a0Deathly Hallows essentially marked the end of my childhood.Now, I'm a twenty-seven-year-old and those feelings have been ripped to shreds yet again.Post Potter Depression.But it's worth it.Harry Potter has always been the most important book series to me since I first read them in 1999\u00a0- I reread the books every year, sometimes more because of reasons - so\u00a0I'll gladly take the punches Rowling continues to throw at me.Worth it.(Book Depository / Amazon US / Amazon Canada / Amazon UK)"}, {"Review": "\u2022 review also posted on Wordpress! \u2022 Warning: This review contains major spoilers! Don\u2019t read this if you haven\u2019t read the Harry Potter series and Harry Potter and the Cursed Child yet!-------------------------------------If you loved Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, I wouldn\u2019t recommend reading my review. This is going to be a rant! You\u2019ve been warned!-------------------------------------This is the very first time I have rated a book one stars! Believe me, I don\u2019t want to do this, but I really didn\u2019t enjoy reading Cursed Child. Before I get started, I want you to know the following: 1. A couple of weeks ago, I read some spoilers from people who had watched the play. Those immediately lowered my expectations. I knew going into this I wasn\u2019t going to like it. 2. I knew this was not written by J.K. Rowling. 3. I knew this wasn\u2019t the eight book, but the script for the play.I love the Harry Potter series so much. And I always will. It means a lot to me and when I heard about this, I immediately pre-ordered it. I\u2019ve seen some people say \u2018it\u2019s Harry Potter so obviously I love this\u2019, but I can\u2019t say the same. Call me critical but I spent money on this. People spend money on tickets to go see the play. I expect something decent in return then.To call this fanfiction is an insult to all the people who try to bring more joy to a fandom. The Cursed Child was just plain bad writing. I will get into detail later, but I refuse to accept what happened as canon. I don\u2019t care what J.K. Rowling says. This is a disgrace to the characters and the people who loved the original book series. You might think that I\u2019m taking this too seriously, but they shouldn\u2019t ask money for this if it were \u2018just for fun\u2019. This is literally being promoted as \u2018the eight story\u2019 in the Harry Potter series. I knew before I started it that it wasn\u2019t, but the marketing team pretends it is.So no, I won\u2019t apologise for being critical. Just because this isn\u2019t a book, but a play, doesn\u2019t mean that the story shouldn\u2019t be as good. In fact, that is such an insult to plays! It\u2019s just another form of media. I\u2019ve seen some people say: \u201cYou can\u2019t judge this if you haven\u2019t seen the play\u201d. Well, if that\u2019s the case, they shouldn\u2019t have published it as a book. I can\u2019t afford going to London and paying a lot of money in order for some people to validate my opinion.Let\u2019s start of with the things I did like:This felt as if I was reading a book. It didn\u2019t take time to adjust to the format. I\u2019m also curious to see what everything is going to look like in the actual play. But, since I really don\u2019t like the actual story and what they did to the characters, I\u2019m not sure yet whether I\u2019d be willing to pay money for that.Out of all the characters, Hermione was the only one who still resembled who she used to be. I\u2019m proud that she has become Minister for Magic! I also really liked Minerva! And Draco proved he was a good parent (much better than Harry\u2026).I enjoyed the interactions between Albus and Scorpius! They\u2019re such good \u2018friends\u2019 (A.K.A. boyfriends).That was it. Those were the only thing I like. My list of dislikes is much longer! I had six full pages of notes. When I read a book that\u2019s over a thousand pages long, I don\u2019t even have that many notes! Let\u2019s get started:The plot is basically 90% about trying to bring back Cedric Diggory. I don\u2019t understand why Albus is so obsessed with Cedric. So many people died for Harry, why does it have to be Cedric? Obviously because Amos asked, but to have almost the entire plot of this play resolve around that\u2026I\u2019d rather read every single second of a class taught at Hogwarts! Because this wasn\u2019t magical enough. Sure, it features the characters we know and love and Hogwarts, but we rarely get to see actual magic. When Albus, Delphi and Scorpius are searching for the Time Turner in Hermione\u2019s office, they don\u2019t even try \u2018accio\u2019! Instead, they search the entire bookcase! Whenever we do get some magic, it isn\u2019t explained enough. Why couldn\u2019t Delphi use \u2018imperio\u2019 on Albus? She said: \u201cto fulfil the prophecy [\u2026] Imperio just won\u2019t do\u201d. Why not? Or when Harry transfigured into Voldemort\u2026 Is that even possible? Why would wizards go through the trouble of brewing polyjuice potion then? All of this is just very convenient, but didn\u2019t make enough sense.One of the things that bothered me most, was Ron Weasley\u2019s characterisation. He has become a caricature of the person he used to be. The only reason he\u2019s there, is for comic relief. All he does is eat and make stupid jokes. They act as if he\u2019s so dumb and doesn\u2019t take anything serious. Did Thorne actually read the original series before he wrote this? Because this is not the Ron I know! I refuse to believe that he was so drunk at his own wedding he doesn\u2019t remember anything. And why would Ron give someone love potion? He had a terrible experience with it when he was a teenager, why in the world would he do that? It doesn\u2019t make any sense!Another character who was completely butchered was Cedric Diggory. In the alternate universe where he lost the Triwizard Tournament, he becomes a death-eater and kills Neville. Cedric was one of the kindest characters. It\u2019s absurd to assume that he would become a racist murderer just because he got humiliated!Scorpius said: \u201cCedric was a different person entirely \u2013 dark, dangerous\u201d. We only found out that he killed Neville, but Scorpius didn\u2019t interact with him. I don\u2019t understand where this observation comes from. And I had that feeling quite a few times while reading this; as if I had skipped a couple of pages without realising it.Harry Potter is a terrible father. I didn\u2019t like him once in this \u2018book\u2019. Granted, Albus is a whiny teenager: he has no idea how privileged he is. Don\u2019t tell me he doesn\u2019t get special treatment because he\u2019s a Potter. A lot of people have it worse than him. Still, Harry had no right to say the things he did. And his excuse? He didn\u2019t have a father figure growing up. He had plenty! What about Arthur, Sirius, Remus, Hagrid and even Dumbledore, Harry?! Harry had no right to attack Minerva either. Just because a woman doesn\u2019t have children, doesn\u2019t mean she isn\u2019t able to take care of them. She\u2019d be a much better parent than he ever was.And when did he become a psychic? His scar hurts, he actually hears Voldemort\u2019s voice and can speak Parseltongue again, but Delphi hadn\u2019t even saved Voldemort yet (actually, she never does). How is he able to do that if nothing has changed? Voldemort wasn\u2019t back, yet he acted as if he was? Once again, I just don\u2019t understand\u2026Also, what is up with Lily\u2019s blanket? I don\u2019t remember him ever talking about it in the books, yet now Harry pretends as if it\u2019s his most precious possession in the entire world. I know he didn\u2019t possess it in the other books, but it\u2019s still strange that he\u2019s so obsessed with it now.Oh, and the special privileges? Harry is at Hogwarts all the damn time! I don\u2019t remember parents being allowed there. I guess being a Potter does mean you\u2019re allowed to do more than others.A lot of people hate Severus Snape and don\u2019t see him as a brave person. While I don\u2019t feel as strongly about that as them, I completely understand why they feel that was. He was horrible to his pupils, particularly Hermione, Harry and Neville. But, in the alternative universe, Hermione and Ron secretly work together with him. He used to be so mean to them, it seems highly unlikely to me they would forgive him! Just because he didn\u2019t turn out to be a death-eater, doesn\u2019t mean it justifies his behaviour. Snape\u2019s interactions with Scorpius were so cringe-worthy. He isn\u2019t a nice guy who makes one or two jokes and he\u2019d never talk that openly about Lily.Because so many characters felt differently, I didn\u2019t care about them anymore. When Hermione and Ron sacrificed themselves and received the dementor\u2019s kiss, I felt nothing. On the one hand, I\u2019m sad we didn\u2019t get to see Sirius, Remus, Tonks an Teddy. But on the other hand, I\u2019m very glad, since their characters would have been butchered as well!This book almost pretends as if the other Potter and Granger-Weasley kids don\u2019t exist. Ever heard of Hugo???The timeline is so strange. Page 22 and a year has past. Page 27 and they\u2019re already starting their third year at Hogwarts. Seven pages later, another year has past! Surely, they could have given us a glimpse at their lives at Hogwarts without having to do it like this. Later on, Scorpius and Albus are in Scotland, without any brooms or wands. Yet the very next page, they\u2019re already in Godric\u2019s Hollow! How is that even possible? Again, this is not explained.And how did Albus and Scorpius know every single detail from what went down over twenty years ago at the Triwizard Tournament and Battle of Hogwarts? Did their parents tell them literally everything? Were very detailed books written? I need to know this!In the alternate universe, they kept mentioning an \u2018Augurey\u2019 and I had no idea what it meant. It\u2019s only explained many scenes later. I cannot stress enough how underdeveloped some plots were. Sometimes, I had no idea what was going on because things weren\u2019t explained well enough. And that causes plot holes.I\u2019m so thankful they didn\u2019t use the Time Turner often in the Harry Potter series. I can already imagine how how things would have ended otherwise: Harry would have gone back in time and kill Voldemort and save James and Lily. Whenever a universe has the ability to time travel, that\u2019s the kind of things that happen. It\u2019s predictable. Yet that\u2019s exactly what Harry Potter and the Cursed Child is about. They go back in time over FOUR TIMES just to go back to how things were at the beginning of the play. It\u2019s such a waste of time. I can think of so many plots that would have been more interesting. Imagine there\u2019s ever going to be a F.R.I.E.N.D.S movie and it turns out Monica has left Chandler and never wants to see her children again. That wouldn\u2019t make any sense at all. But that is how Cursed Child feels like to me.Prisoner of Azkaban is one of my favourite books an films, so I obviously have no problems with time travelling. But this was just too much.As I\u2019ve mentioned before, I really missed the magic. And of course the characters, because Cursed Child completely butchered them. Think of how much better this would be if it was about one school year at Hogwarts, without Voldemort trying to kill everyone. Just one year of the adventures Scorpius and Albus encounter. There didn\u2019t need to be this much family drama. Honestly, I\u2019m pretty sure this was the script of a Days of Our Lives or The Bold and the Beautiful episode instead! Just think how they could have explored the other houses, besides Gryffindor! But no, in Cursed Child, everyone is still prejudiced towards Slytherins and they pretend Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff don\u2019t even exist!This is only about three hundred pages long, yet it was so repetitive. Scorpius and Albus do something stupid; Draco, Harry and Ginny run after them and need Hermione because \u201ctheir children are missing!\u201d AGAIN!I also had some problems with the writing itself: Voldemort Day? \u2018Oh Potter\u2019 instead of \u2018Oh Shit\u2019? Mudbloods in the dungeons? The Blood Ball? WE GET IT, VOLDEMORT IS BACK! \u201cA Malfoy who may be a Voldemort\u201d Euhm, that\u2019s just awful writing. \u2018Voldemort\u2019 isn\u2019t a last name; it\u2019s not as if \u2018Lord\u2019 was his first name. It should have been \u2018Riddle\u2019 instead. \u2018Thank Dumbledore\u2019 instead of \u2018Thank God\u2019 is not only cheesy, it is also incredibly arrogant. I\u2019m not the most religious person but to say that Dumbledore is a God\u2026 It\u2019s so sexist that at the Triwizard Tournament, every school got a lot of cheers besides Beauxbatons! I know boys also attend it, but it\u2019s still more \u2018feminine\u2019 than Durmstrang or Hogwarts.Almost everyone who has read this, can\u2019t deny there is something going on between Albus and Scorpius. They are so gay! But of course, this book is heteronormative to the max! I can already hear J.K. Rowling in a couple of years: \u201cActually, they were dating, but it wasn\u2019t important to the story\u201d. Please don\u2019t give this woman any praise when it comes to diversity, she doesn\u2019t deserve it. The Cursed Child could have meant a great deal more if they weren\u2019t so afraid to include characters who aren\u2019t straight for a change. And don\u2019t even get me started on Albus\u2019 crush on Delphi. He\u2019s like fourteen and she was twenty? That\u2019s disgusting.Which brings me to Delphi, the daughter of Voldemort and Bellatrix. Do you really expect me to believe that Voldemort was capable of love and lust? Why do they feel the need to establish that every character is \u2018oh so straight\u2019?! Supposedly, Bellatrix gave birth to Delphi before the Battle of Hogwarts in Malfoy Manor. WHAT?! In Harry Potter and the Deadly Hallows, we actually see her there! Don\u2019t you think anyone would have noticed? DRACO ACTUALLY LIVED THERE! How oblivious is he supposed to be then? This doesn\u2019t make any sense!I could go on, but I think I\u2019ve made my point. There were so many things that bothered me and I don\u2019t ever want to read this again. I regret paying this much money for it. I refuse to accept this as canon. I will pretend this doesn\u2019t exist.

Nice Natalie: What are you, narrating a movie? Don't scare them. All major spoilers are hidden, but really, we recommend going into The Cursed Child blind. Drop by after you finish!Cynical Natalie: Alright, let's get down to it. What the flip did we just read? Nice Natalie: A lovely story about family and threads we didn't know needed to be tied up, but made perfect sense when we read it. I always thought Harry was a little too caviler after the Battle of Hogwarts finished. We finally get to see the guilt-ridden PTSD part. Cynical Natalie: Stop dancing around the question like One Direction asked about Zayn's departure. You know what I'm talking about. (view spoiler)[Bellatrix and Voldemort's daughter. (hide spoiler)] The brainchild of fanfiction writers.Nice Natalie: I admit it was a weak plot element, but I liked the parallel. The Cursed Child is ultimately about family and Harry connecting with his son. (view spoiler)[You can't say you didn't feel a little bit sad when Delphi finally thought she was meeting her father. She must have had a lonely childhood\u2014like Harry. I bet if she looked in the Mirror of Erised, she'd see the same thing he did. (hide spoiler)]Cynical Natalie: Hooray for literature class. But that element is so full of plot holes, logic runs clean through. (view spoiler)[Bellatrix wasn't pregnant in the Deathly Hallows.Nice Natalie: Rowling didn't plan on writing an eighth story then. And pregnancies in the Wizarding world might work differently. She might have used dark magic to speed up the terms and replenish her body right before the Battle of Hogwarts. You don't know that.Cynical Natalie: I know it's ludicrous. Given that I accept your tissue-thin rationale, Delphi is a sorry, one-dimensional excuse for a villain. Nice Natalie: Time constraints. Rowling didn't have seven books this time. (hide spoiler)]Nice Natalie: Can't you focus on the good for once? What about the trick Albus and Scorpius used to send for help? That's old-school Rowling at her best, disguising useful plot objects as the mundane in the beginning and then whipping them out like a boss further down the line.Cynical Natalie: Because there's too much bad to focus on the good! Like why is Albus such a fucking idiot? (Those who want to go in the Cursed Child completely blind might want to avert your eyes) Why would he attempt to go back in time and save Cedric? Screwing with time is a bad idea, especially during a period so entwined with Voldemort's existence. Nice Natalie: I've had a lot of time to think about that. Remember that interview with Rowling? She said she deliberately smashed all the Time-Turners in Order of the Phoenix, so characters couldn't go back and mess with her plotlines. At the same time, she had Hermione drill into Harry and Ron\u2014and by extension, us\u2014that fiddling with the past was a bad idea. Albus missed that lesson. He doesn't know the dangers of playing with time. When he made that decision, he was extremely angry with his dad and got a bit reckless. Like father, like son. Harry used to do reckless stuff when he was mad too, like diving into Snape's thoughts or going off to find Marvolo's ring.I think if it were in book format, we would've gotten a deeper insight into Albus's thought process and rationalized his behavior, like we always did with Harry's.Cynical Natalie: You're so far up Harry's ass, you can't even see straight.The Cursed Child kinda makes me hate Harry. He abused his authority and position. Teenager Harry would've hated him.Nice Natalie: He never claimed to be perfect. And that moment you're talking about was after Albus and Scorpius went dickering around in the past. It had to have caused ripples in his personality.Cynical Natalie: While we're talking about the first altered timeline, I can't believe my intelligent, level-headed Hermione turned into a bitter spinster just because she and Ron didn't get married. Nice Natalie: I didn't read it like that. I read it as a Ron/Hermione moment. She needs Ron's humor to balance out her stuffy side and Ron needs someone who will understand him on Hermione's level.Cynical Natalie: Oh, I didn't realize Ron mattered anymore. Because he's clearly been downgraded to the comic relief character. One of the main themes of the original series was to show Ron was more than a sidekick. He was his own person, brave and loyal, and deserves to stand in the light instead of the shadows of his friends.Nice Natalie: Again, I read it as far more positive. Ron isn't the insecure teenager he was anymore. He has nothing to prove, not to himself, not to anyone else. He's comfortable on the sidelines. After all, according to Rowling, this is the guy who resigned from his job as an Auror to run a joke shop.His role during the climax was beautiful. (view spoiler)[Harry chooses to stay behind to witness his parents' death and Ron says, \"We'll watch with you.\" That's him; that's the youngest male Weasley to the letter. (hide spoiler)]Cynical Natalie: There are still a lot of inconsistencies. Why is McGonagall the headmaster? Rowling said she \"getting on a bit\" in an interview and Hogwarts got a new headmaster after the Battle.Nice Natalie: She probably didn't want so many new characters. That's partially why Luna, Teddy Lupin, and most of the Weasleys didn't show up. Let it go, will you? It's a tiny thing.Cynical Natalie: Fine. What about\u2014to quote the fine folks over on Twitter\u2014the gay panic with Albus and Scorpius?We're not the kind of people read homoerotic subtext in everything. We didn't see it with Naruto/Sasuke and we don't see it with Dean and Castiel from Supernatural. It's not until others pointed it out that we saw potential signs. But the sexual tension between Albus and Scorpius was off the charts. I was shipping them from day one. And the shit Rowling has them say... My God.Snape's famous declaration and \"They belong together\"\u2014Right, absolutely platonic.Nice Natalie: Rowling probably wanted to go for a Lily/James parallel with Rose and Scorpius. You can't please all the shippers.Beside, like you can hate anything that has to do with Harry Potter.Cynical Natalie: ...Nice Natalie: Right?Cynical Natalie: ...I hate you.Nice Natalie: But you don't hate Harry.Cynical Natalie: This is a sentimental rating, not a logical one.Nice Natalie: We read on emotion, darling.Cynical Natalie: Fuck off.Other Nice Natalie/Cynical Natalie brawls reviews:The Fault in Our StarsA Girl Like YouIf I StayDreams of Gods & MonstersThe MartianMe and Earl and the Dying GirlCatching FireAll The RageAn Ember In The AshesThe Hammer of ThorThe Ship of the DeadCaravalWarcross"}, {"Review": "J.K. Rowling could punch me in the face, and I'd still like it. The truth is, this isn't one of her stories, and it shows. For one, it's not even a book.Regardless, the magic is here, and I like it just the same. The plot might be convoluted and crazy, but the world is magical enough for it to somehow work. It makes for all the thrills and mystery you come to expect from the Harry Potter universe.Coming back to this series felt like returning to school after a long summer break. Although it takes place 19 years later, it seems to pick up right where the originals left off. Dumbledore returns as a moving painting, there's time-turners and polyjuice potion and sneaking around in invisibility cloaks and raids on the Ministry of Magic. It's silly yet serious, and filled with thrills and intrigue, and most of all fun.But more than any of that, the Harry Potter universe is known for its characters, and in this installment, a couple more can now be mentioned with the best. Harry's son, Albus, is an outcast--everything Harry isn't, in a bad way, and the two struggle to relate until Albus becomes so isolated he starts falling down the same path that Voldemort did. And then there's Draco's son, always around, leading Albus down the wrong path, bringing up bad-blood from the past, and helping Albus make monstrous mistakes--all while having a personality that's sure to win you over."}, {"Review": "As you can see on my pre-review, I'm beyond excited for this script book and relive the magic at Hogwarts. It's automatically one of my most anticipated books of 2016 but due to the mixed reviews circulated, I decided to hold it off to clear my mind from expectations and wait for the hype to go down. Until now I'm still hesitant to read but screw it. I'm gonna dive in and let's see if I'm going to enjoy it. Here's what I thought when I finished this book:My fear just got real. This book is truly disappointing. The plot is ridiculous and the characters feels so...strange. They're not acting like themselves. I'm questioning Harry Potter's behavior. He turned into an insensitive and arrogant guy. Regardless he's a father, this is not the Harry Potter I knew from books 1-7. He matured a lot from those books and learned from many people in his life including Albus Dumbledore, Hagrid, Sirius Black, Remus Lupin etc... I don't like Albus Severus. He's a reckless, ungrateful, stupid idiot. Most of the time I want to crucio his butt for acting impulsively without THINKING TWICE (view spoiler)[Stealing a time turner to travel back time to save Cedric Diggory and the fate changes. Can you imagine Voldemort unleashed the darkness and rule the world? It's a living hell.  (hide spoiler)]. The craziest part I've ever read was about Voldemort (view spoiler)[having a daughter.....with Bellatrix Lestrange?! (hide spoiler)] WHAT. KIND. OF. SORCERY. IS THIS?!Despite of my rants, it still feels nostalgic and I surprisingly love the Malfoys. Scorpius Malfoy is freaking adorable and props to Draco talking more sense than Harry does. The change of heart feels weird but it's truly nice to see him. As for Scorpius and Rose -- they're like the Dramione (Draco-Hermione) we never had. Therefore; I'm giving it two stars instead of one star. -----------------------------------Pre-review: 2016The Eighth Story.Nineteen Years Later.Merlin's Beard.
