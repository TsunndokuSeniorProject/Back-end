{"Name": "Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix", "Image": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1546910265l/2.jpg", "Reviews": [{"Review": "Seriously, don't read this review if you haven't read the books. The biggest compliment I can think to give an 870 page book is that I wish it had been longer. I wish this had been longer. This book has always been my favorite in the series. Up until it, Harry\u2019s story had been filled with light. Sure, there were some tough parts earlier on, and while it's true that some darkness crept into the ending of the previous installment, for the most part, that was a pretty happy book compared to this. Ron got over his jealousy, the school eventually got behind Harry as a Champion, and good still triumphed over evil. Our hero surmounted impossible odds in the Triwizard Tournament and then managed to escape Voldemort, yet again, and warn the wizarding world of his return. And then BAM!The beginning of this book hits you in the face. Where you expect Harry to be in the know, he\u2019s in the dark, where you expect The Daily Prophet to be filled with stories about the ministry pursuing Voldemort, there\u2019s only silence, where you expect excitement about returning to Hogwarts there is only frustration and angst. And you know what? You get it, you frigging get it, man. Because you were with Harry when he faced Voldemort and his Death Eaters alone, you stood beside him as the shades of his parents appeared from the tip of his enemy\u2019s wand and helped save his life. And when he made it back to safety, you were just as dumbfounded as he was when the minister of magic refused to believe him, refused to believe Dumbledore. So how dare they? How dare they let him rot, alone, in a house full of people who hate and ridicule him, while the murderer of his parents begins to rebuild his army? How dare they feed him snippets like \u201cWe can\u2019t tell you anything about what we\u2019ve been doing, and we\u2019ve been doing A LOT. But don\u2019t worry, we\u2019ll see you soon, we just can\u2019t tell you when\u201d? As if he hasn\u2019t been through enough. If anyone has the right to know what\u2019s going on, it\u2019s Harry. Doesn\u2019t anyone KNOW him like we do? Or do they just think that they know what\u2019s best for him better than he does? And that\u2019s part of the genius of this installment. This book grows up. Where the previous four could be labeled as children\u2019s stories, this one cannot. There are so many hard lessons and difficult themes in this, ones that a child\u2019s mind cannot fully grasp. Gone are the heroes, gone are the happy endings. This book teaches you that adults aren\u2019t the perfect protectors you thought they were. Sirius isn\u2019t infallible. James Potter isn\u2019t infallible. Albus frigging Dumbledore isn\u2019t infallible. None of them are. None of them are even fully good. And come to find out, those you thought were fully evil might not be either. This book introduces you to shades of grey, and each revelation seems to hit you harder than the last. Normally, I hate angst. This is mostly because I find the vast majority of what I see these days to be a sorry excuse to lengthen a story or a shoddy attempt to distract a reader from glaring issues. Trying to cover up weak characterization? Add some angst! Want to hide those holes in your plot? Add some angst! The only type of angst I can stand is believable angst. Rowling delivers on this. And that\u2019s one of the many reasons that I love this book. There are a lot of other reasons, Fred and George\u2019s badassery, Ginny Weasley finding her voice and becoming a character in her own right, the undiluted rage that coursed through my body every time I read a scene that included Delores Umbridge, the incredible courage and honesty of Hermione Granger, the loyalty of Ron Weasley, Neville Longbottom coming into his own, the failed Occlumency lessons (I WILL ALWAYS HATE SNAPE) and the way the entire school ended up doing exactly what the sorting hat suggested at the beginning of the year and banded together as one against the ministry\u2019s interference. I even loved the ending. YES, I SAID IT! And do you know why? Because life isn\u2019t sunshine and roses and you don\u2019t always get to say goodbye to those you love. You don\u2019t get the sense that Sirius\u2019s death was a righteous one. You don\u2019t get resolution. He didn\u2019t make some grand sacrifice to save the lives of many others. He died taunting the bad guys, smiling at them, egging them on as though he was still that ego-inflated teenager you glimpsed through the pensieve. And then you find out that it was all for nothing. That there were so many ways that it could have been avoided. How do you deal with that? The best you can, I guess. So while I don\u2019t necessarily \"enjoy\" this book as much as I do the others, it remains my favorite in the series for the reasons I listed above.Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Pinterest"}, {"Review": "\u201cIs it true that you shouted at Professor Umbridge?\"\"Yes.\"\"You called her a liar?\"\"Yes.\"\"You told her He Who Must Not Be Named is back?\"\"Yes.\"\"Have a biscuit, Potter.\u201dThis is my favourite book in my favourite series of all time. It's so rich of detail, so full of mysterious and often dark magic. So much character development, so many brave people sticking up for their friends. It's also the book that introduces us to my most hated fictional character ever. Never have I hated anyone as much as Umbrige. And being able to create such deep anger and loathing in me, with only words!, shows again what a fantastic writer Mrs. Rowling is.Here are some of my favourite scenes, characters and details:1. Mrs. Figg beating up Mundungus and cursing Dudley2. Grimmauld Place and the Order3. Thestrals4. McGonagall vs. Umbrige (Harry's Career Advice appointment is one of the funniest scenes in the whole series)5. McGonagall and Trelawney vs. Umbrige6. The Teachers vs. Umbrige7. Peeves giving Umbrige hell8. Hermione setting up a meeting with Luna & Rita Skeeter9. Dumbledore's Army meetings10. Ginny dating whoever she likes and not giving a damn11. St. Mungo's12.

Rowling really starts taking the series down a darker road in this book. She is so talented at character development, and it really shines in this book. Here, Harry is 15 years old, and for most of the book, he's whiny and self-centered, just like a typical teenager. I also adore Dumbledore's role in this book--his conversation at the end with Harry put me to tears. Rowling did an amazing job with the character of Umbridge...never have I hated a fictional character more than I hated her. I do have to admit, I'm curious to see whether she makes any more appearances or not. For me, this book was stronger for character development than plot. Yes, this is a key book for the series, but I felt like most of the book was spent with characters' internal issues and development rather than the plot. I love how Harry and the crew are dealing with more adult issues now, such as relationships and death. As with all of her books, I have a really difficult time putting these books down, but especially within the last 100 pages, I physically could not separate the book from my hands. Overall, another outstanding addition from J.K. Rowling. "}, {"Review": "re-read August 2018it had seriously been too long since I read this book! I love angsty Harry and all of the crazy drama that this book contains. Re-Read in December 2014 for Harry Christmas To Youok. I will start by saying that this is one of my least favorite books in the series, and that isn't because it's bad, BECAUSE IT IS DEFINITELY NOT. It's mainly due to the fact that I hate Umbridge more than words can translate, and having to read about her so much just infuriates me, rather than giving me warm fuzzies the entire time I'm reading.That being said, here are some of my thoughts on the book:-mention of Regulus Black near the beginning of this book. I've noticed particularly during this re-read that J.K. Rowling tends to mention characters a book or two before they will have any importance to the story. She seriously knew what she was doing while writing these books.-it's so weird to think that Sirius is related to Narcissa and Bellatrix! Sirius is such an amazing human, and he was born into a terrible family, which is pretty true of a lot of people. Just because you come from something/somewhere terrible, that doesn't mean you can't be different and be good.-Ron and Hermione becoming prefects is just so great. Surely there would be a better candidate in their year to be the male prefect, yet Dumbledore chose Ron. Why? Because Dumbledore knows that Ron always feels worthless in comparison to his five older brothers, and him becoming prefect was enough to make him feel like a winner at something. Dumbledore is cool like that.-Quite often I forget that St. Mungo's exists since it's not in the movies at all. Here, we get to see Neville's parents, as well as Gilderoy Lockhart (who is adorable now and not at all annoying), and I WISH THAT WAS IN THE MOVIES.-it sucks that Harry was banned from playing Quidditch this year, as I LOVE Quidditch. and Harry was so sad because of it, which made him cranky and quite insane. HOWEVER, I love that Ginny took over for him as Seeker. I feel like Ginny has grown up so much already, and it's particularly in this book that I grew to really like her. She's so much better in the books than in the movies.-In the epic fight near the end of the book, NEVILLE IS SO BADASS. If you ever think that Neville isn't brave until the last book, you are wrong. He was throwing himself at Death Eaters and Stunning the shit out of everybody. It was awesome.-As usual, lots of information was revealed in the last couple of chapters of the book. This particular book reveals A LOT of stuff that most people were probably wondering about whilst reading the other four books, as well as information that you probably didn't even think of. I love how many answers we get in this one.I THINK THAT'S IT FOR NOW. I have a lot of feelings, so I might add more later."}, {"Review": "Finished this one last week and forgot to mark, but I loved it. I ended up taking a massive break for several months because I'm such a mood reader but I really have always loved this one. I remember missing the magic as a teen since Umbridge was being Umbridge but the last act remains one of the most exciting in the series. And I was really happy to get to revisit the scene where Harry talks to Nearly Headless Nick about why some wizards become ghosts and why most don't. I always wanted that scene in the movie, but it's beautifully done in the book. Also loved the extensive conversation between Harry and Dumbledore, which was also reasonably shortened in the film. #AdamRereadsHP"}, {"Review": "Despite this being the longest book in the series, I read it quicker than all the others. Here\u2019s three things I really loved about it: 1. Harry and Sirius- they never had much time together but the time they did have really influenced Harry\u2019s development, a few wise words from a sincere friend (or godfather) can go a real long way. And this scene was perhaps the most powerfully written in the series for me, we all know what happens next: 2. Dumbledore\u2019s Army- Harry, Ron and Hermione have always taken matters into their own hands; they\u2019ve never waited for someone to come along and save them. And here they have got so many great characters involved in their heroics, which leads me onto my next point. 3. Luna Lovegood- because the weird people are always the best people. Luna\u2019s by far my favourite character because she is so completely herself in all her colourfulness; she\u2019s often ignored, avoided and even ridiculed as a result but secretly she is brilliant. The world needs more Luna Lovegoods. I always thought she had far more chemistry with Harry than Ginny ever did. "}, {"Review": "English (Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix) / Italiano\u00abThe hottest day of the summer so far was drawing to a close and a drowsy silence lay over the large, square houses of Privet Drive. Cars that were usually gleaming stood dusty in their drives and lawns that were once emerald green lay parched and yellowing; the use of hosepipes had been banned due to drought. Deprived of their usual car-washing and lawn-mowing pursuits, the inhabitants of Privet Drive had retreated into the shade of their cool houses, windows thrown wide in the hope of tempting in a nonexistent breeze. The only person left outdoors was a teenage boy who was lying flat on his back in a flower bed outside number four\u00bbThe \"big number 5\", the longest novel of Harry Potter series, begins... \"HolyMadonna, how big is this book?\" my daughter says, without fear for the number of pages, she looked more excited for the opening of this new adventure. And it starts with a bang, with two dementors attacking Harry and his cousin Dudley in a muggles area, out in the open. The rules of the usual Rowling's game have definitely changed. . The axiom \"before we'll be between the welcoming arms of Hogwarts, and after many things will happen\" no longer exists. The previous chapter of the series, also, started in the spirit of this new trend: you're not safe anywhere. Everything is more complicated for Harry Potter, it is difficult even to sleep by now.\u00abThere is a room in the Department of Mysteries that is kept locked at all times. It contains a force that is at once more wonderful and more terrible than death, than human intelligence, than the forces of nature. It is also, perhaps, the most mysterious of the many subjects for study that reside there\u00bbLet's talk frankly, the entire novel revolves around this room and what's on it, and there are numerous signs and things said that make me think that we will be back on the argument in the future. In fact, despite a series of revelations came about this room at the end of the novel, an air of mystery remains.And sadness remains too. So much sadness.Vote: 9\u00abIl giorno pi\u00f9 caldo dell'estate \u2013 almeno fino a quel momento \u2013 volgeva al termine e un silenzio sonnacchioso gravava sulle grandi case quadrate di Privet Drive. Le automobili di solito scintillanti sostavano impolverate nei vialetti e i prati un tempo verde smeraldo si stendevano incartapecoriti e giallognoli, perch\u00e9 l'irrigazione era stata proibita a causa della siccit\u00e0. In mancanza delle loro consuete occupazioni \u2013 lavare l'auto e falciare il prato \u2013 gli abitanti di Privet Drive si erano rintanati nella penombra delle loro case fresche, con le finestre spalancate nella speranza di indurre una brezza inesistente a entrare. La sola persona rimasta all'aperto era un adolescente che giaceva lungo disteso sulla schiena in un'aiuola fuori dal numero quattro\u00bbComincia il \"big 5\" di Harry Potter, il volume pi\u00f9 lungo della serie. \"O Madonnamia quanto \u00e8 gigante\", dice mia figlia quando lo vede, per nulla spaventata dalla mole, anzi eccitata da questa nuova avventura che sta per iniziare. E comincia col botto, con due dissennatori che aggrediscono Harry e il cugino Dudlley in piena terra babbana, alla luce del sole. Sono definitivamente cambiate le regole del gioco della Rowling al quale eravamo abituati in precedenza, ossia prima si arriva tra le accoglienti mura di Hogwarts e poi succedono tante cose. Non pi\u00f9. Gi\u00e0 il capitolo precedente della saga era iniziato all'insegna del nuovo trend potteriano: non si \u00e8 pi\u00f9 al sicuro da nessuna parte. Per Harry \u00e8 tutto sempre pi\u00f9 complicato, gli riesce difficile perfino dormire in santa pace.\u00abNell'Ufficio Misteri c'\u00e8 una stanza che viene tenuta sempre chiusa. Contiene una forza al tempo stesso pi\u00f9 meravigliosa e pi\u00f9 terribile della morte, dell'intelligenza umana e della natura. E forse il pi\u00f9 misterioso fra i molti soggetti che vengono studiati laggi\u00f9\u00bbParliamoci francamente, l'intero romanzo ruota attorno a questa stanza e a quello che contiene, e ci sono molteplici indizi e mezze frasi dette che mi fanno pensare che si ritorner\u00e0 a parlare di essa, tentando di chiarirne l'essenza misteriosa, che per\u00f2 permane nonostante tutta una serie di rivelazioni a fine romanzo.E permane tristezza. Tanta tristezza.Voto: 9"}, {"Review": "\n\n\u275dThings we lose have a way of coming back to us in the end, if not always in the way we expect.\u275e\n\nRating: \u2605 \u2605 \u2605 \u00beI feel like I'm going to get attacked for only rating a Harry Potter book 3.75 stars but Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is probably my LEAST favorite of the series thus far. It went by so slow and I felt like too much went on but at the same time nothing really happened. This book could've easily been made at least 200 pages shorter if J.K. Rowling got rid of all the pointless details and chapters that added nothing significant to the storyline. The movie was never really one of my favorites either and that was probably the primary reason it took me more than a month to get through Order of the Phoenix.On top of that, I wasn't a big fan of Harry in this book. I understand that he went through a whole lot after the events of Goblet of Fire but he was moody and a jerk to everyone around him 98% of the time and although I can empathize with him, it became too over the top for me and I got tired of it real fast. He just kept snapping and going off on all the wrong people and it got really annoying. All the constant CAPITALIZED yelling didn't help too much either.Even though Order of the Phoenix was my least favorite movie and book, I LOVED the concept of Dumbledore's Army. I just loved seeing all the students in action and actually putting everything they learned into good use. We finally get to meet Luna Lovegood, one of my favorite Harry Potter characters of all time, and I was so ecstatic every time her name was mentioned.As for Umbridge, she was also the ultimate villain in this book. She was the woman you LOVED to HATE and I felt the movie nailed this portrayal so perfectly. If J.K. Rowling's goal was to make you want to rip your own hair to shreds, she succeeded that and more.Overall, I felt the book was unnecessarily long but the movie itself was not much better. Where the book felt too slow, the film adaptation felt too rushed leaving out key details. Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix will probably always be my least favorite book and movie in the series, but the worst Harry Potter book is still a whole league better than a lot of other books."}, {"Review": "Full review and other non-spoilery reviews can be found @The Book Prescription* On a scale from one to ten, how obsessed with Harry Potter are you?me: about 9\u00be"}, {"Review": "Guys, this was so much better than the movie. I know it's not fair to compare, but because the film version of Order of the Phoenix isn't one of my favorites, coupled with the fact that this is the longest novel in the series, I was really nervous to get to this one. Obviously I was a muggle fool who deserves to be chased around by Peeves for a full 24 hours, because this was such a vital installment that really breathed a mature life into the series. The ending of Goblet of Fire is quite dark, but I felt book #5 is where the series really gets down to business and loses the childlike innocence that it clasped tightly for some long. What a brilliant, hauntingly beautiful way to write a series that grows as the reader does. Only two more to go, which makes me quite sad, but also excited to find out how they compare to the rest!"}, {"Review": "AHHHH I AM FINALLY FINISHD. *collapses in a puddle* Peoples, I usually read a book in a day, two days if it's big, three if it's super huge. THIS BOOK TOOK ME FOREVER. I know there a lot of super-keen Potter fans out there, so, um, you may not want to read this review. But! But! WAIT! The biggest thing you need to know is: I seriously love this series. I do. It's so detailed and thorough and interesting and I totally see why it's captured the world in it's wizarding claws. BUT. I didn't grow up reading it. And now? Reading it? I love a lot of things, but there are so many things that bother me, particularly about The Order of the Phoenix. THINGS THAT BOTHERED ME:+ The freaking gargantuan size. This is the most important thing to note. IT IS HUGE AND IT SHOULD NOT BE THIS BIG. The first 100-pages are numbingly boring...they cleaned house? SO WHAT. + Ron/Hermione's bickering drove me nuts. This trio of \"friends\" act so often NOT like friends, it just really grates on me. I know friends have their ups and downs, but Ron is downright rude. Harry is usually oblivious, but he doesn't help things much either. Of COURSE I'm Team Hermione here, and I know she gets together with Ron...but I ain't shipping it.+ The last 50-pages were so intense and interesting...WHY WERE THEY SO SHORT?? It's like the book FINALLY warmed up and got going and got exciting and -- BOOM! -- it's done now. Plus so many interest reveals just come as a Dumbledore info-dump. Um. Seriously?+ The characters, in general, drove me nuts. I love Dumbledore, don't get me wrong, but he's awfully passive. There's this whole attitude around like \"Awww, well nothing TOO BAD is going badly, so let's just wait until it gets absolutely horrific before we do anything, shall we?\" AND ARGHHH YOU STUIPD STUPID WIZARDS.+ And Harry's logic...I mean, lack thereof...was frustrating. Like \"Omg, a teacher is physically abusing me...I won't tell! I'm a strong brave little melon!\" NO YOU'RE A FREAKING IDIOT. Harry's whole mantra of just suffering in silence made me so so angry.+ Snape. Because it's a grand idea to have a teacher who abuses and bullies students because he had a crappy childhood. Solid work hiring him, Dumbledore. I HATE SNAPE, BTW.+ In general, the book's huge GARGANTUAN themes of \"injustice\". This one is very very much me, but social injustice and discrimination against children and adults exercising their age as a way to control/lord over younger humans -- I HATE IT WITH THE FIRE AND PASSION OF A THOUSAND SUNS. Sure, yes, it has it's place in books. It's realistic. But every time I pick up a Potter book, I just get smothered with how unjust everything is and it makes me SO ANGRY. And while there are 2 dozen things I love about these books, THAT is what makes me wait, like 9 million years between picking up volumes. There should be more balance. There should be more fighting back instead of passiveness.+ And please, someone remind me why Harry still needs to live with the Dursley's? Because I think we've established he doesn't. Another = injustice for no reason.OKAAAAY BUT YOU GUYS PROBABLY THINK I HATE HARRY POTTER NOW AND IT'S NOT TRUE.I also have a list of things I freaking loved. And at the end of the day, I do like this series. I don't \"adore\" it like a true Potterhead, I 'spose. But I do enjoy it.THINGS I ABSOLUTELY LOVE:+ The detail. okay, I do complain that the books are too big (they are) but I have to admit this makes the worlds SO INCREDIBLE DEEP. Like all the food details, the off-handed comments, the descriptions, the subjects. IT'S INSANELY AWESOME. It's not like reading about a bunch of kids going to school...it's like genuinely being there.+ The fact that they actually had to DO SCHOOLWORK. So often I read books about characters who are not \"geniuses\" but still manage to save the world AND score uber well in school without doing a scrap of homework. NO. So I love that Harry Potter makes them save the world AND do their homework. And half the time I think their homework sounds freakishy fascinating. Yes, I'm having a Hermione moment.+ HERMIONE. I ABSOLUTELY LOVE HER. She is like one of the biggest reasons I love this series and would even consider rereading (seriously!! I just said that!! Even though I complain!! I'd like to try audios one day...) because she's smart and into equality and rights and I just love her, yes okay?!+...oh and McGongall. I love her too. SO SO MUCH. She does not take a single piece of crap from anyone. SHE IS AMAZING. I love how she fought Umbridge, although I think she could've done more (like stabbed Umbridge in the eye or something) and I love how she's fiercely protective of her students. She's like a super scary mum.+ The Weasleys. ALL OF THEM! Even Ginny is getting more a personality now! YAAAY. I particularly love Fred and George and I'm glad they're living their dream. (Oh, but obviously I hate Percy.) Ron is not my favourite person unfortunately, because I think he's very self-obsessed and I do find him irritating at times. BUUUUT MRS. WEASLEY IS SO FEIRCE AND WONDERFUL.+ Also Luna...although I wish she had a bigger part. Maybe she will in future books?! I love her and her whimsical attitude. She's totally fascinating.+ And Neville is amazing. I particularly love how when Harry was teaching the secret Dark Arts class how Neville was just THRIVING. He didn't feel threatened, and he had one-on-one help with a peer he likes and respect. EQUALS = HIM DOING SO WELL. YAY!! I feel so so annoyed at this book too because I feel Neville has a learning disability and everyone just ignores it. Some teachers do a bit more, but mostly he gets abused - by teachers and students alike. I knoooow stuff like that happens IRL. But we're not reading real life are we??? We're reading about a WIZARD school and I'll be damned if I don't sit here and demand things like learning disabilities should be given respect and help. I love Neville. KEEP FIGHTING NEVILLE.+ And no matter how much I complain...I actually lost track of time while reading this!! That's right! I was reading and my eyes were burning at night and I was like \"OMG WHAT'S THE TIME?!\" so I totally read a lot later than I would usually. A book that absorbs me is definitely a good book.SEE?! I DO LIKE IT. Mostly. (I hated Umbridge of course, but duh. Who doesn't?) Ultimately it was too big and I got a wrist sprain just holding the jolly hardback, BUT! It's intense and magical and intriguing and I want to know what happens next. Also I want to see the movies."}, {"Review": "Hello, I think this is my favourite book in the entire series, but also I barely remember what happened because I read most of this over three days while on vacation. All I recall is my parents yelling at me to do something other than read, all that good Sirius, Neville and Ginny content (my three faves), that terribly wonderful frustration that existed every time Umbridge spoke and the introduction of Luna Lovegood. Also, sobbing my eyes out. We remember that very well. *tagging this bc no one tags HP spoilers and it's hurt me one too many times, but you know what happened... we all know what happened.*(view spoiler)[ My biggest and only problem with this book was and continues to be Sirius' death.

It is saved only by the virtue that it is a Harry Potter book and moves the series along to the still yet unknown finale.My issues with it:- deals with complex social/political problems in a simplified, extreme, and dichotomous manner- characterisations are too easy/lazy- all good or all bad (with the exception of Snape who's good/evil intentions are yet unknown), all courageous or cowardly, the righteous or the corrupt. - Malfoy junior is the most incompetent nemesis in the history of evil. And whilst this was acceptable in the earlier books where there was an element of the comical in his attempts to be evil, by book 5, where the themes have become signifantly darker, he and his side-kicks' unchanging and inane attempts to foil Harry's ultimate fate have just become annoying. The only saving grace is that Harry has more than enough true and worthwhile enemies and obstacles for the reader to really get bogged down by Malfoy's silliness. - the laudable themes of power/corruption/propaganda/censorship are played out with such naive characterisations, extreme situations and melodramaticism that it results in inflammatory knee-jerk reactions rather than furthering understanding of the subleties of these ideas. - the plot seems confused, as if JK Rowling has all these ideas, but is unsure of where she ultimately wants to go, thereby leaving in all these subplots that neither has entertainment, wisdom nor story-advancing value. EG what's with Grawp and the freaking giants??Overall- read it only as a part of the greater goal of coming closer to the ending of the series."}, {"Review": "I don't think I (once again) need to mention how much I love J.K. Rowling's writing style. She is able to create this magical world filled with lovable, interesting and layered characters with simple, but very effective words. Her storytelling is the perfect blend of humor, sadness, suspense and pretty much everything else that makes a good book, and it's going to be something I will highly miss once I finish this wonderful series.One might think that the fifth book in a series doesn't bring much new stuff to the overall plot and might even just be written to prolong the finale, but this is not the case here. The story that gets told helps to establish and develop so many things - no book of the series has been a filler so far! Despite the book being so long (my copy has 800 pages), no line is boring or unnecessary. I didn't even feel like I read so many pages, because it was so entertaining.Like in my review of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, I need to praise the portrayal of friendship! These characters are just normal teenagers with normal conflicts and fights, and I'm so happy that (besides all the fantastical elements) these ordinary things find a place in the story as well. This makes this adventure so much more special, because you truly see these characters grow up and learn!"}, {"Review": " Edit #3: 27/3/2015  I am still getting positive feedback over this and every time I read what you guys and girls have told me, my heart swells. Gosh, I am so proud of this review.  Edit #2: 25\\7\\2014So I came across this article today, and for some reason, it made me happy!! I feel evil *evil laugh* http://mea-news.net/en/index.php/2014... Edit #1: 8\\3\\2014It has been four months that I posted this review. And so far I have received great feedback. Thank you everyone for yo#ur support ^^ Remember, this is not a benign cause. 6/11/2013I know that I have neglected the subject of the new Goodreads policy a lot recently, and I ought not to have done that. You see, I wasn\u2019t very free recently, and well because I didn\u2019t know what to either say or on what book should I post it. And then I read this book, and the rebelliousness in this book made me think that hey, this book is perfect for what I have in mind. Oh, and guess what! I am going to be aggressive. Let me tell you something maybe a lot of you people are not aware of. We, people who live in the Middle East, look up towards the west, where presumably, everyone is free to say and do whatever they want, bounded by no tradition or religious law whatsoever. But when this kind of law is forced upon everyone from the west itself, we lose hope. We lose hope that anything will be good again. And well for someone (me), who has suffered a lot because of that (Facebook only made my freedom of speech more restricted), I found a haven for myself in Goodreads, where apparently no one gives a damn whether you insult or disagree with them because well, they don\u2019t care. And because they are mature enough to ignore any insults under the pretext that it is \u201cyour opinion\u201d.Do you know how much I love that? I have suffered A LOT because of that. Let me tell you something about myself. I never EVER stay quiet about something that I believe to be true \u2013 even if I was wrong to many other people \u2013 and now Mister Money-Head-Of-Amazon has to ruin that for me. All right, I realized that everything that was said about the new policy was said in the utmost civilized way. But guess what! I am a teenager. I don\u2019t give a damn about manners, and I am about to say what everyone has wanted to say for a long time. Goodreads by succumbing to the green papers have restricted my freedom of speech. In the last few years, I have been bullied, put down, humiliated, insulted, punished\u2026 just because I wanted to say what I had in mind, just because I always stand up to what I believe in. And since because ALL OF THAT HAPPENED TO ME, I turned towards Goodreads where I was surprised that no one cared about whatever I said, and always respected me when I wanted to express myself. No review of mine has been removed, but a lot of people\u2019s reviews have been removed. Since it didn\u2019t affect me yet, I should shut up, right? No! Just the fact that it exists is bothering me. It is like having this law around forbidding people to eat chicken, and I hate chicken, but that doesn\u2019t mean I should keep quiet. Okay, that was a bad example, but the closest I had to the ridiculousness of what we are fighting for. No one should fight for his right to express himself freely. It is a right. We are born with that right. And no number of reviews removed is going to change that. It is not going to frighten us. It is not going to make us back out. You can remove all the reviews you want, Goodreads, but this is something I believe in. So I am fighting, even if you have to ban me. Well, according to your own policy, you can't do that. Well, you can't even remove the reviews that have been put  before  the declaration of that censorship but you do it anyway. So you are bunch of hypocrites. You, Goodreads managers, anyone with the IQ of a peacock can realize that what you have done is so wrong on so many levels. If I were the Goodreads manager, I would say this to the Amazon Manager when he came offering the new law \u201cYou can take your money and your pathetic ass out of my office! You cannot threaten us with money or hold it over our heads! This company has so far made you millions of money just by existing and promoting your books! More than half of our members buy regularly from your website! In fact, according to this logic, you owe us!\u201d GR Manager slaps Amazon Manager. Jackie Shan bursts into the scene wearing nothing but a newspaper around his waist. Kung fu! Jackie kicks Amazon Manager\u2019s head off, and his body goes around looking for its head. Meanwhile, GR Manager holds both the head and the body and throws them from the window of the headquarters. BOOM! The end. This policy is so wrong. If people like us cannot express themselves online, then where will they? I might not insult your precious little authors, Amazon Manager (in my opinion they shouldn\u2019t be called authors if they can\u2019t take god damn criticism. Not everyone should approve with them), but I have every god damn right to express myself freely without having to worry whether my review would be removed or not. The management even has no right to go around reading whatever we say online because well, I thought they had better things to do. It turns out I was wrong, don\u2019t you think? Anyway, what we say online is OUR concern, not yours. You shouldn\u2019t threaten us. You shouldn\u2019t condemn us. Maybe to you, you are only deleting a review, but to us you are restricting our freedom. And no one really appreciates freedom but the ones who have been deprived from it. I wonder how the Goodreads Management even agreed to this. I had a lot more to say about this on my mind, but I think I have made my point quite clearly. Us, readers, and the ones who write a bit like I do, find words our strongest weapon. Back to my review about this book. THIS WAS THE WORST BOOK I HAVE READ! I have cried 50 pages straight. (view spoiler)[ why did she have to kill Sirius?WHAT DID HE EVER DO TO HER? I AM STILL CRYING YOU KNOW!  (hide spoiler)]The 5 stars I have given it, it was not a \u201cWOW I LOVED THIS BOOK AUTOMATIC FIVE STARS!\u201d No. It was this kind of books \u201cit deserves 5 stars, with a little dash of wow at the end\u201d. This is the kind of perfect books that makes you feel as though all happiness, innocence and hope had been sucked out of the world, and until everything in the book is fixed, nothing in the world will ever be right again. I have really a lot of controversial feelings about this book, but it all goes down to one point. It is good. It is worthy of five stars. And it had hooked me up five days straight."}], "Genre": "Fantasy", "ID": "2", "Desc": ""}
