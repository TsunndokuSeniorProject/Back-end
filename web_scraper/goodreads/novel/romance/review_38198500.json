"}, {"Review": "The misadventures books might be completely stand-alone, but this one had a lovely treat for us who have read Misadventures by Elizabeth Hayley! We got an epilogue to Blake and Gavin's story!!! Isn't that great? It was a good end to a book which I enjoyed. I wouldn't have minded an epilogue for Brooke and Cole's story. I would like to see what these two were up to a few months or years later. I have to admit that this wasn't my favorite story in the series, but it was good and it had some strong moments that made it one of the best. I think that Brooke gets the most focus on the story, which I didn't mind, but I would have liked to see more of Cole and his life before he met her. Both of them are in a place that's in the middle of two major moments in their lives. Brooke is trying to get away from she had before and find her place once again and Cole is just going on a road trip that will change his life unbeknownst to him. I enjoyed seeing them go on their journey and finding out what was planned for them. Both of them were likable and I loved them equally. I am sure you will enjoy the book as much as I did and dare I hope, even more. "}, {"Review": "Misadventures with a Country Boy by Elizabeth Hayley is book 19 in the Misadventures series.

We\u2019ve got two people running from what\u2019s wrong in their lives and coming together to find what they were missing. We\u2019ve got mystery, adventure, drama, and just an overall captivating mix.Cole, our steamy main man, is fresh out of the Army, on a journey to visit his friend in Oregon, when he runs into Brooke at a gas station. Brooke, well, we don\u2019t know much about Brooke, without spoiling the story that is. But, we do know she\u2019s stranded without a car at the gas station where Cole stops for gas and coffee. Good guy Cole offers Brooke a ride, and so we embark on our journey.Elizabeth Hayley is actually two women, Elizabeth and Hayley. They have such a unique writing style, as they write together, but the story flows seamlessly. I felt a connection to Brooke and Cole that I haven\u2019t felt with the characters I\u2019ve read about lately. Elizabeth Hayley made Brooke and Cole relatable to, in my opinion, anyone who has never felt whole or fulfilled, like they were missing something or just have never felt good enough. I\u2019m sad to let Brooke and Cole go, but I cannot wait to continue on my Misadventures journey and get my hands on Elizabeth Hayley\u2019s next installment in the series."}, {"Review": "Name\u2019s Cole, but I am fond of nicknames.Cole is out of the army and needs to change in his life, what he didn\u2019t expect was to run into a woman at a gas station in the middle of Kansas while on his way from Georgia to Oregon.

Misadventures with a Country Boy left me breathless and aching for more. I felt like I was falling and losing my heart over this wonderful masterpiece. This book is more than sweet words. It is NOT like anything I have read before. It has all the sweet magic and charm of a southern romance. Misadventures with a Country Boy is a story that screams for a 5 stars rating. I love everything about it: adorable, lovable characters and a unique storyline that had me glued to the pages of this book until I devoured the last chapter.

Each chapter made me feel all the emotions. I smiled. I cried. I wanted to kill and at some point the suspense and drama got the best of me. It fascinated me how easily I loved this book. I was caught in the story. It made me happy and sad at the same time. Cole and Brooke took a piece of my heart. It all started with a southern Prince Charming saving the Princess...Who has ever thought that a stranger could change your world and turn it upside and down? Because we are taught to be aware of strangers and not to trust them easily but what happens when the attraction is stronger than anything? When the pull is sparkling addiction there is nothing you can do... only to fall into de temptation... That is exactly what Brooke and Cole will experience together. They will discover themselves and in the same way they will change each other life in a wonderful and tearing way. They came from different worlds. They are trying to find who they are. However they belong together. The ex-military southern Charmer and the Princess are such a dangerous and beautiful combination. In my opinion, Cole is literally a Prince Charming. There is no doubt he is the ultimate book boyfriend. He is sexy and hot as sin. There is something mysterious and intriguing about him that make you want to discover all his secrets. His southern manners, worn-in Levis and sweet dimples are dangerously charming. I found it really hard not to fall in love with him. On the other side we have Brooke, the strong heroine who is lost and running from a life she doesn\u2019t want. She wants a simple life surrounded by true people. But how can she take of herself when she has never done it? Finding Cole and accepting his help save her. There will be adventures and an attraction that she will resist until the desire consumes her. Resisting Cole\u2019s southern-charm will be an epic task! The story of Cole and Brooke is a soft and deep romance where both characters finally took control of their life. They will find a real and sweet love which they deserve after everything. I have the feeling that Cole and Brooke story deserve more chapters.Reasons why I love this book: It is addictive. It is consuming. It is perfect. It is original. It is everything. "}, {"Review": "Misadventures with a Country Boy begins with Cole Timmons on a cross-country trip to Oregon to see his best friend, Jimmy. He's trying to put as much distance between himself and his hometown in Georgia. He thought after he got out of the Army that things would be different, but they weren't. He makes a stop at a gas station along the way and encounters a young woman seemingly in need of help, or, at least a ride. Brooke Devereaux is in a hurry to get to.......well, she doesn't quite know where. All she knows is that she wants to get as far away from Pennsylvania as she can. When she encounters a stranger at a gas station in Kansas who offers to help, she is immediately wary, but he doesn't seem to recognizer her, which is a plus. Add to that he's headed west, and the fact that she needs a ride, and she reluctantly accepts his offer. What begins as a guarded friendship eventually turns into a tentative friendship. Cole seems to be a good guy, but Brooke knows that can just be for show. He also seems to have some secrets himself, and that suits Brooke just fine. However, when secrets are revealed and withheld facts come to light, will the two of them do what they do best and run? Or with they have the courage to stand up to the road blocks in their lives? Misadventures with a Country Boy is the second book I've read in the Misadventures series. It is nicely written and the characters are engaging. Yes, there was instant attraction, but the story was about more than that. Brooke was a bit na\u00efve, but through no fault of her own. Her parents' hold on her will leave you seething and will explain why she ran. Cole's backstory? Absolutely heartbreaking. But, his meeting when his best friend, Jimmy, will leave you in a puddle of tears. Once he realizes that he's been running from pretty much everything and everyone his whole life, he knows just what he has to do.......thanks to Jimmy. This is the first I've read by Elizabeth Hayley, but has made me interested in seeing what else she has. If you're a contemporary romance fan, you'll enjoy this one. Well done, Elizabeth Hayley!"}, {"Review": "This book was such a fun read. It was my second novel from Elizabeth Hayley and I enjoyed every single second. I will be on the look out for more from these two fab romance authors for sure. \n\"You belong in the world while all I want to do is exist on the fringe of it.\"\n \"Misadventures with a Country Boy\" follows the story of Cole and Brooke, two people from very different worlds that were brought together through fate. I loved the characters in this book. As soon as I met Brooke, I was intrigued by her and that intrigue just kept on growing the more that I read. I wondered what Brooke's history was and what were the reasons behind her actions that lead to her meeting Cole. As I began to discover Brooke's back story, I understood and could empathise with her struggles. I found myself rooting for Brooke to have the future that she wanted. Especially if it was with sexy country boy, Cole. Cole truly was Brooke's hero, finding her when she needed someone the most. From that moment on, Cole took care of Brooke, giving her the support that she deserved. He was a sexy alpha, protecting her like a knight in shining armour. He was also extremely sexy and gave the story an extra blast of heat. Together, the pair sizzled. \n\"I can't let anyone else have you. You're mine. So if I don't deserve you, I'll just have to become someone who does.\"\nI adored the progress of Brooke and Cole's relationship. I loved every moment of their blossoming love. It made my heart happy to see how perfect the couple were for one another. I'm not saying it was all blissfully happy. It wasn't all hearts and flowers for Brooke and Cole, however everything turned out in the way that I wanted and I had a huge smile on my face as I reached the last page. I was more than happy with how cute Cole and Brooke's story turned out. I was also given a lovely surprise as there was a gorgeous bonus chapter from \"Misadventures with My Roommate.\" I was so excited to read more from Blake and Gavin. \n\"Did you think I was going to let you out of my sight? Silly boy. You're stuck with me now.\"\"That's everything I could want.\"\n"}, {"Review": "I received a copy of this book from the publisher/author to review for Stephanie's Book Reports.Brooke Deveraux has a lot she wants to escape from: a career she never asked for, a future she doesn't want, and parents who've only ever see her as a business opportunity. But in her desire to experience live, she quickly realizes she's lacking in one very important skill-how to survive on her own. Former soldier Cole Timmons is an expert at running away. Whether it's from his rural hometown, alcoholic father, or painful memories. Cole doesn't hesitate to leave...Until he encounters an out-of-place woman at a gas station in the middle of nowhere. The wealthy \"princess\" couldn't be more different from the country loner, and the pair get off to a rocky and misadventurous start. But sometimes exteriors are armors meant to deceive. Sometimes what's beneath reveals more than anyone ever realized. Sometimes in order to stop running away, a person simply needs to find something to run toward. Welcome to the story of Cole Timmons and Brooke Deveraux. Cole is fresh out of the army and is serious need of a change in live. So on his way to Oregon from Georgia he runs into a woman at a gas station in the middle of Kansas. Brooke is struggling and it is much needed that she get away from her family. However she gets stuck in Kansas and can not get a car and totally isn't expecting the sexy stranger who comes to her rescue.

This is a sexy hilarious ride and you get to figure out if Cole is the next Prince Charming or Ted Bundy. Don't miss this book. Don't miss any of these Misadventure books. I have loved everyone of them I have read.

He has own issues and burdens weighing heavy on his mind. But he can't leave Brooke behind who is running from her parents and celebrity lifestyle as pop princess that she doesn't want at all. They both hide their identity or personal details because they don't trust each other. A beautiful journey begins when they decide to take the journey to Oregon together in Cole's car. We see some breathtaking nature tour through the Rocky Mountains, the forests and the small towns.With each passing days they fall in love with each other. They have fun. They have freedom from their worries. They have passion and true emotions. Until the reality of Brooke's life comes crashing and they leave in a bitter note. What will happen next? Would Cole find his way back to Brooke after realizing his mistake a little too late? I can just say the ending was epic and so swoon worthy!I loved this over all truly adventurous feel of the story! The author has a great eye for details and I had such a great time travelling with the amazing couple. Cole is a great guy full of sexy arrogance, sense of humor, protectiveness and good ol' southern charms. Brooke's character was interesting too. She may have moments of insecurity and weakness but she finally refused to let other people dictate her dreams. The story had some funny adorable moments, some sexy scorching hot moments and some deeply emotional moments. The story has something for every reader. You get sweet and sassy.You get erotic and romantic. You get an adventure of life and love.(ARC from author and Bare Naked Words) "}, {"Review": "Well the delightful Elizabeth Hayley penned another fabulous Misadventures story that I absolutely couldn't get enough of once again, and even gave a bonus to her previous one to boot. See, Cole Timmons, who is out of the military now, is coasting through life with a bucketful of regrets, so he's in his truck for a road trip, when he comes across a beautiful woman with a lot of pain in her eyes, who needs some help. So he somehow talks her into taking a ride from him. Brooke Devereaux is on the run from her life out of the spotlight trying to experience life on her own, but doesn't count on the difficulty of lying low. So when the handsome stranger offers a ride, she's not sure, but finally takes a chance on him, and this takes them both on an emotional journey, and maybe just maybe, both will be able find some freedom from their demons. I loved this story, as Brooke & Cole had great interactions that kept me laughing quite a bit. It didn't hurt in the slightest that they had some chemistry sparking up either to be honest. But I think what I loved the most, was how they found what they needed in each others company, especially Cole, who was suffering greatly from his past demons. They were so heavy that I felt his pain, and it had my eyes threatening to leak when those demons were revealed. Did these two make some stubborn decisions in this journey? Well, of course they did, otherwise, it wouldn't have had any realistic feel if they didn't, nor would it have allowed my f-bombs to drop either. So yeah, this was another great read in this amazing series. HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMEND TO ALL! "}, {"Review": "I have read the majority of the Misadventure series and just like the rest, this book did not disappoint. The series can be read in any order which is a plus, Even for someone who is very OCD about reading books in order. We meet Cole, who\u2019s down right handsome. Raised with manners of a true southern man, and served for his country. God.. Who doesn\u2019t love a man in a uniform?! When needing a change of pace in life Cole hops into his truck and is traveling towards Oregon, where a former military buddy currently resides. Fate always has a way of playing its hand when you least expect it. Brooke is a girl on a mission. A mission, to get as far away from her controlling family and a promising career. Brooke stumbles upon a gas station that\u2019s happens to be selling a vehicle, she has the means to purchase but not wanting to prove her identity to do so, is denied the purchase. *Enter sex on a stick* Cole who is a complete stranger to offer her a ride to where ever she decides she\u2019s going. The playful banter amongst the two will make you laugh. There\u2019s even some parts that will make you cry. And a few more swipes of the pages and your caught up in a steamy sex scene where the chemistry is off the charts. What I enjoyed the most was the adventure. The not knowing, getting to learn a little bit more of our mysterious Brooke and falling even more in love with Cole for being so charming. It\u2019s a read that\u2019s worthwhile, a must read and read again! "}, {"Review": "Brooke Devereaux has a lot she wants to run far, far away from- overbearing parents who forced her into a career that she never wanted, a future she never asked for, and did I mention her overbearing parents who could care less about her unless she was making them money?Yeah. Talk about ouch.So Brooke does the most logical thing any 24-year-old girl does: She runs away. Sadly, Brooke wasn't blessed with knowing how to survive on her own. Yet somehow, by the grace of God and the heavens, or the Fates, she ends up at a gas station in Kansas. And that's where she runs into a sweet Southern cowboy by the name of Cole Timmons.Cole knows a lot about how to be on the run. He's on the run from his drunk-of-a-father, memories of being a soldier, and a darker secret that's haunted him for years. When he runs into an out-of-place woman at the gas station, something pulls at him to help her out. So he offers his \"Princess\" a ride to wherever she's going. Little does he know, Brooke has no idea where she wants to go, be in her life or in destination.So what's a country boy and a wealthy \"princess\" do together? They take a road trip that leads the pair on a discovery of freedom, release, and truths. The two of them realize that sometimes it takes more than running away to face one's fears; it takes someone finding something to run toward that will break down the walls and barriers."}, {"Review": "Another Misadventure book with another couple that sticks to your heart.Brooke wants to get away from the life that her parents build for her without asking her what she really wants from and with her life.Although some may think she has it all, she can't live that life anymore and find herself wanting to start a new life in another place where nobody knows her for her name or inheritance.Cole is a country man that served in the army but now is also trying to get away and start a new life in other state far away from his past and family and it's a bit heartbreaking all his backstory and very understandable why he wants to leave it all behind. After she gets to be alone and without a car in a gas station where he stops for gas and coffee ,although she is wary of him then realises that he doesn't know her so she could get on the road trip with him and what a road trip really. The authors have such a talent to describe a more than visual surroundings that I felt myself in the car with the couple.They get to know each other a little bit every day through their journey and it's full of funny moments,facts from their past and what they wish for their future,it's a slow burn love story filled with good banter and very real characters.Another misadventures book and another new to me authors that won't be new in the future."}, {"Review": "To ride with a stranger or not. Former milatary man Cole is running away from his painful past. He has no idea where he is going but he does know who he's going to see. A friend from the military. On his road trip, he stops at a gas station. He hears a woman yelling at the manager.\u00a0 She claims she has no ID and when the manager tells her she can't buy a car with no ID she leaves in a huff. Cole pays for his things and leaves.

Cole and Brooke get off to a rocky start. They also have arguments a long the way. Brooke still doesn't tell Cole who she is and she's so afraid someone will recognize her.

It was nothing what I expected but that is a blessing. It was such a good story. It was full of so much emotion from anger, fear, love, and just overall happiness. I loved Cole. My heart went out to him from the beginning. I could tell he had some heavy baggage he was sifting through and I wanted to hug him and help him through it. Plus his blonde shaggy hair had me drooling along the way.Brooke also had my heart in knots. Not romantically, but just as someone I wanted to help through her problems. We have to wait a chunk of the book to find out what she is running from, but that adds so well to the suspense and emotions that flow through the pages. I know it isn't easy what she was running from and I commend her for doing something for herself even when she doesn't know what she really should be doing.This story left me in a book hangover and wanting to know more about things go in their lives. I could continue to read about where they end up and read about them as elderly warm in their beds. I am so glad I picked up this story and know I will cherish it for many years to come!"}, {"Review": "Country Boy and his Princess....Cole Timmons is the epitome of a country boy. Kind, masculine, polite, easy going and treats all the ladies with utmost respect. It was no surprise that he would come to the aid of a damsel in distress at a gas/truck stop in the middle of nowhere. Brooke Devereaux was in a tough spot and needed a ride as fast as possible out of there. Cole took one look at her and determined that this filly screamed high maintenance and spoiled brat. Cole being the gentleman that he is could not resist offering his assistance, that and the fact that he found Brooke intriquing and definitely easy on the eye. As they took off together on their road trip, Cole found himself wanting to learn more about this Diva. Both Cole and Brooke have turbulent pasts that they are not proud of. As they got to know each other better on the road to \"anywhere\" they discover each other's true self. Elizabeth Haley takes us on their journey of revelation together.

I've loved them all!! This one was incredibly well written, with a bit of humour and whole lot of sass. But, to be honest, I wasn't keen on Brooke, I didn't particularly like her bratty attitude but I LOVED Cole. He's a laid back alpha male, insanely hot and hella patient!The story itself was great and I found myself really really enjoying it the whole way through but Brooke's character let it down a bit for me. I don't think I've rolled my eyes so much in a long while, especially at a book. Pet hate? Bratty, childish characters. To me, she was more a thirteen year old than a 22 year old but hey ho.I've not read any of Elizabeth Hayley's books before, and I really do love discovering new authors. I liked her writing style, the way she forms the characters very subtly and leaves the reading guessing about their pasts, it makes it a lot more interesting. I'll definitely be looking up her other work."}, {"Review": "Yeeeeehawww! Everyone needs Misadventures with a Country Boy in their life! What a fantastic read! Cole and Brooke were a pleasure to read about. Cole runs into Brooke at a gas station. She is without a car and in need of help. Cole being the charming man he is offers her a rid and we go on an amazing journey with these two characters. These two characters are definitely in my top five of the misadventure series couples. They both are running from the things going on in their lives and wind up finding things they weren't even looking for. I love a fast read and this was like the other Misadventures in that way. I devoured it in a few hours and loved every single second of it. I discovered Elizabeth Hayley from their first Misadventure and I absolutely adore them. These two women are absolutely fantastic writers and I loved their first Misadventure. This Misadventure was an absolutely amazing addition to this wonderful series and it is a must read."}], "Genre": "Romance", "ID": "38198500", "Desc": ""}
