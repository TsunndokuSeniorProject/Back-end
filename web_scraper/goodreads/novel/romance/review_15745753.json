{"Name": "Eleanor & Park", "Image": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1341952742l/15745753.jpg", "Reviews": [{"Review": "Should I break out in song and dance to \"Baa, Baa, Black Sheep?\" One lonely star. I'm just as surprised as you are, considering I just KNEW going into Eleanor & Park that I would love it, love it, love it. What reason would I have to believe otherwise? Almost all of my friends loved this book and have sworn fealty to the Goddess of Feels and Might, Rainbow Rowell. And I get it because she is a pretty awesome person and I think she is totally lovely. So trust me when I say I REALLY wanted to love this book. In fact, I am blindsided that I didn't, saddened that I can't join the Eleanor & Park Kool Kidz Fan Club and disappointed at such a disjointed reading experience.Random Reasons Why I Didn't Like This Book:1. The Romance My main issue stems from the romance between Eleanor and Park. I just... didn't get it. Though, that's not for lack of trying because I had many arguments with Adult Me and Teen Me in my brain. Teen Me remembers the infatuation of meeting someone exciting and experiencing all those special moments for the first time. However, with Eleanor and Park, it was entirely unrealistic and unbelievable.Park went from \"God! Just sit the fuck down, Eleanor!\" to \"God, she has incredibly soft hands.\" Eleanor went from \"That stupid Asian kid\" to \"He's so pretty. I love his hair! I want to eat his face!\"The next thing I know, Park is telling Eleanor that he's in love with her, how he can't imagine being without her, that she's IT for him. Then Eleanor is telling him she doesn't breathe when she's away from him. Adult Me was not on board because the romance moved entirely too swiftly for my feelings to catch up with the events that were taking place. No, I take that back. \"Swiftly\" would indicated that there was some sort of actual pacing involved, but that was absent. One day they disliked each other and the next they were holding hands and proclaiming their love. I remember listening to that part while I was out on a morning run, and I had to stop and rewind because I legitimately thought I missed an entire chapter. But then I realized that I hadn't and I argued with myself. Adult Me: *twitch*Teen Me: Yeah, but remember when you thought you were in love with that guy and how you were going to marry him?Adult Me: Yes...Teen Me: So obviously they're not going to be together forever and ever and gallop into the sunset, but you can't discount those feelings. Adult Me: *gumbles* I KNOW THAT. But I also never wanted to eat a guy's face...Teen Me: Please don't tell me I grow up without a heart. Adult Me: ...2. The Historical BackgroundEleanor & Park takes place in Omaha, 1986, where there's racial tension. Park is half white and half Korean. He spends most of his time trying not to be noticed by other kids at school and struggling with his own insecurities over his mixed heritage. Yet, oddly, throughout the entire novel, Park doesn't encounter any racism. Apart from a few brief monologuing sessions about his classmates thinking he was Chinese, Eleanor's off-hand \"stupid Asian kid\" remarks and Park's own dislike for, in his opinion, looking too feminine, there wasn't anything that felt accurate. Park's character had so much more potential that was not utilized. I was hoping for something more from his development regarding how he viewed himself and his mother. Perhaps a certain level of acceptance or resolve would have been appropriate. There were also two black girls who befriend Eleanor, but even they don't seem to face any racism in this predominately white neighborhood. It was like Rowell deliberately tip-toed around them and instead threw in a reference to the community being offended by a black boy getting a white girl pregnant. Strangely, the only one who seemed to get picked on was Eleanor. I do think it's awesome that this novel had diversity, something that is sorely missing in YA, but I wasn't buying what Rowell was selling. At the same time, Rowell never let you forget that this book was set in the 80s since Eleanor & Park is overloaded with pop culture references on almost every other page. (I admit to chuckling to the 867-5309 reference.) Still, we also never forgot Park was Asian with Eleanor constantly referencing it in her narration to the point that I started feeling uncomfortable. 3. The Narration I wasn't a huge fan of the back and forth narrative and found that it annoyed me more than anything. This is where I wonder if my rating is more an indication of how I felt about the audio vs. the actual story. I disliked both of the narrator's voices. The parts of Eleanor's dialogue that was \"snarky\" wasn't portrayed with the right kind of emotion. Park's narration was slightly better, but the narrator, Sunil Malhotra, bored me to tears with his monotone reading and unbelievable voice for Eleanor. 4. The StoryI'll be honest and admit that it's possible that I didn't \"get\" this book. It may have just gone way over my head. Why? Rowell tried to cram a lot of story and situations into one little book and it didn't work for me. Before going into Eleanor & Park I was told that the ending was heartbreaking, but I didn't feel that at all. Rowell relies on Eleanor's grim family life to spark sympathies from readers and I can see how this works and why it's marketed to John Green fans. However, the ending relies on your connection to their romance to feel the heartbreak. The problem with that was, by the end, I wanted to know what became of Eleanor's mom and siblings, but the focus was instead on her feelings for Park and letting him go. Eleanor spent a good amount of the story in this terrible environment, feeling these feelings and when I genuinely wanted to know her feelings about everything, all I get is a freaking post card and the book ends. Since the romance was doing absolutely nothing for me, I needed for the plot to come in and rescue this book. It did not. I'm not saying this was a terrible book. Not by a long shot. It's clear that this story has touched a lot of people and I wouldn't go as far to not recommend it, but I also think this is a bit overhyped. I went in with really high expectations, thinking I was going to be blown into next week by the awesome. Instead, I'm walking away with feelings brewing a special pot of \"meh.\" Even still, I'm holding out hope for Fangirl...More reviews and other fantastical things at Cuddlebuggery Book Blog."}, {"Review": "\n\u201cI don't like you, Park,\" she said, sounding for a second like she actually meant it. \"I...\" - her voice nearly disappeared - \"think I live for you.\"He closed his eyes and pressed his head back into his pillow.\"I don't think I even breathe when we're not together,\" she whispered. \nThree stars is not a wholly negative rating but I have to admit that I'm disappointed with this one. Eleanor & Park has enjoyable parts, but the only real difference I can see between this and Pushing the Limits is that the characters in the latter are meant to be hot. Which could have been interesting because I've always preferred reading about the so-called freaks, losers and ugly people, but these two books follow the same generic pattern of teen love stories with a whole ton of behind-the-scenes angsty issues. Though this one was less entertaining.It's 1986. Eleanor is the new girl and she is not only genetically made to look like a victim but she does herself no favours by pairing her looks with a bizarre fashion sense. Having nowhere to sit on the school bus, she takes a seat next to the clearly reluctant Park. Park is half-Korean in an extremely white school, but he is given enough respect by the popular kids to help him get by. His home life, unlike Eleanor's, is pretty much perfect apart from a bit of badgering by his dad. Slowly over time, these two individuals develop a relationship that is formed around stuff like reading comics together and exchanging mix tapes. And other nerdy things like Star Wars and Shakespeare - which I could easily relate to. I think one of the major problems I had with this book is that I failed to get a sense of the attraction between them. Their relationship to me seemed more suited to friendship than love. The progression from reluctant bus partners to friendship was natural in the story, but I then felt that the jump from that to romantic and/or sexual feelings was too fast and unbelievable.Not only that, but where I felt the start of their relationship avoided the usual cliches and did something a bit different (like the way their relationship begins without them speaking to one another), I felt that once they were \"together\", it quickly dissolved into the usual sweet nothings and thoughts like \"I'll die if I never see him again\" after knowing each other for a few weeks. This isn't instalove, but it's silliness. Or perhaps I really am just a cold-hearted, unromantic person. And I also didn't like the way chubby Eleanor receives self-validation through Park:\n\u201cHe made her feel like more than the sum of her parts.\u201d\nI did like the well-rounded feel of both characters, though. The author gave them many different levels, making them experience a range of emotions in a realistic way. I also thought the darker element of this novel were mostly handled well. Eleanor's home life is revealed gradually in a frightening way. But it does just make it easier to compare this book to Pushing the Limits. And I don't like it when serious issues like domestic violence are used to fuel the love angst and create a Romeo and Juliet kind of forbidden love scenario. It just leaves a bad taste in my mouth.Eleanor & Park will be great (hopefully) for fans of quirky, nerdy romance stories with an underlying dark angsty side, and for those who love nerdy references. If you don't usually like young adult romance and were eying this up as possibly being the book to change all that... you'll probably be disappointed. It has good parts, but it's not that different from anything else out there.Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube | Store"}, {"Review": "\n\n\nIf you've experienced that first love - that heart-wringing, soul-squeezing, crush-the-air-out-of-your-lungs-whenever-you're-apart first love - this book will bitch slap your feels all to hell. I love it. I love its warmth and its vibrancy, its heartache and its pain, its humor, its meanness, the ugliness, the beauty, the crying, the laughter, the sarcasm. I love Eleanor and I love Park, and I love that there's still a tiny chance for them...and for everyone whose first love was torn away. Even if you never see that person again, they change you in ways that no one else will ever understand. They will always, always hold that little piece of your heart that no one else will ever be able to touch. I love you, Rainbow Rowell, for giving me this. Thank you."}, {"Review": "I should have read Eleanor & Park during winter, when it\u2019s freezing outside.Because it completely warmed my heart, and it\u2019s so hot already, I thought my heart would burst into flames inside my chest.Believe me or not, but I always thought I was immune to the usual young adult romanticism in books. You know: hand holding, shy smiles and flushed cheeks. I didn\u2019t think I would ever feel actual butterflies reading a YA contemporary romance book.But I did. And it took me by such surprise that at first I didn\u2019t even know what it was. What? Can a book really have this kind of effect on a human being?Well, I have my answer now.Eleanor & Park\u2026 It\u2019s like they\u2019re the main reason why the word ''love'' exists. They symbolize true love. It\u2019s not dirty, or sickening, or lustful or manipulative. It\u2019s like two angels fell in love and you can see a halo above their heads and all you can think is ''God, I wish them forever. If they can last, then maybe there is hope for the rest of us,'' and then you can\u2019t help but cry.I wanted to lock the characters some place safe where they could be together, forever protected from the looming danger in the world.Oh god, I can\u2019t believe it took me this long to read Eleanor & Park.Blog | Youtube | Twitter | Instagram | Google+ | Bloglovin\u2019"}, {"Review": "I fully admit that I'm a sucky book reviewer. This book for me was so personal that this review is just for me. Eleanor is just that girl. The weird one that people pick on. Who knows exactly why? She doesn't stand up for herself, she doesn't fight back. I was that girl. This is me my 10th grade year.\nIf this book had been around then I would have completely worn the pages out. As it is I feel like highlighting and just re-reading the thing until it falls apart.Talking about Romeo and Juliet Eleanor's comments were \"It was 'Oh my God, he's so cute' at first site. It's Shakespeare making fun of love.\"Exactly.I hated PE class. That was the worst time of my school life. Not because I didn't want to participate..that's just when the mean girls/boys were the worst. \"I'm going to tell Mrs. Burt that my mom doesn't want me to do anything that might rupture my hymen. For religious reasons.\" I can't tell you how many notes I forged in my mom's name and how creative I was in those reasons.Park's thoughts on Eleanor at one time. \"He couldn't figure out why it upset her so much. Sometimes, it seemed like she was trying to hide everything that was pretty about her. Like she wanted to look ugly.\"Believe me..you do get to that point. You don't really understand why. Your mind just completely gets to the point where if everyone else thinks badly about you, so do you.I never had my Park. I did have friends. But I can remember when the teasing started that I could see the embarrassment on their faces too. You hate to see that but it happens. I don't think worse of them now. It just happened. I ended up leaving home at age 15. I went out on my own and met new people and guess what? I wasn't judged like I had been in middle and high school. I realized it was just that group of people. I can be included in groups of people and liked for who I am. My daughter faced some bullying last year at school. Not because of what she looked like or wore. (she is beautiful) She was picked on because she stood up to the bullies that were picking on a friend of hers. So I did learn something from my teen years. I raised someone who just won't stand for it.And now me? I'm the queen bitch of you piss me off and I'll tear your arm off and beat you with it. (well in words anyways). Remember guys and girls. What doesn't kill you makes you strong as hell.

But not here. This story was perfection. I think I liked it even better than Fangirl, simply because it was more dramatic and poignant. Eleanor and Park (the people) stole my breath.The initial story starts out with Eleanor, the new girl in school, getting on the bus for the first time and having no place to sit. Everyone is staring, no one helps her out, including Park. Finally, Park caves in and scoots over so that she can sit down, but he does it grudgingly, almost angry with the stupid redheaded girl in the frumpy man clothes who made such a spectacle of herself. Over the next weeks, these two go from pointedly ignoring each other to a reluctant yet silent cameraderie, bonding on the bus over Park's comic books and eventually music. Once their silence is broken, the floodgates sort of open, and they become fascinated with one another.The dual point of view here quite literally MADE THIS STORY. Being in Park's head as well as Eleanor's was paramount to my enjoyment. Park has a romantic soul, made evident by the way he thinks of his Eleanor, the way he goes from train wreck curiosity to utter fascination and adoration with the awkward girl with so many secrets...he stole my heart.`*~`*~`*~`*~`*~`*~`*~`*~`*~`*~`*~`*~`*~`*~`*~`*~\n\u201cEleanor was right.

Eleanor comes from a broken home...quite literally, her home is broken. Her parents, both not so great to begin with, are divorced. Her mom remarried a man who loves to drink and loves to bully...and bully he does, but he does so much more. Eleanor's back story is one to make me feel like the world's best mom quite simply because I could never allow what happened to her to happen to my daughters. And yeah...her mom ALLOWS this bastard to treat Eleanor like trash, allows her daughter to be left alone and scared, without the support and love that a parent owes their children. Park, on the other hand, has a wonderful home life. His Dad met his Mom in Korea, married her and brought her home. They still kiss and hold each other like they haven't seen each other in months. They are simply adorable, and no matter how Park rolls his eyes, the reader can tell that his parent's love for each other gives Park a wonderful sense of security that he absolutely takes for granted...as kids really  should be able to.It takes awhile for Park to realize what kind of life Eleanor is leading.`*~`*~`*~`*~`*~`*~`*~`*~`*~`*~`*~`*~`*~`*~`*~`*~ \n\u201c \u201cMy girlfriend is sad and quiet and keeps me up all night worrying about her.\u201d \u201d \n`*~`*~`*~`*~`*~`*~`*~`*~`*~`*~`*~`*~`*~`*~`*~`*~It seemed to me that this high school love story is one of the few that I can actually see continuing on through the years and becoming...more. The bond between Eleanor and Park is already so deep, so strong. Nothing will keep them apart. They are young but they are realistic. They are also made for each other, and though Eleanor seems to be more skeptical, I know that deep down, she wants this to be a forever kind of thing...more than any other wish in the world, aside from her tragic circumstances, against all of the odds, she just wants Park. `*~`*~`*~`*~`*~`*~`*~`*~`*~`*~`*~`*~`*~`*~`*~`*~\n\u201cNothing was dirty.

But I don't have any regrets for rereading this wondrous book. This review contains *spoilers*.Eleanor is the new girl in town, and with her chaotic family, her mismatched clothes and unruly red hair, she couldn't stick out more is she tried.Park is the boy at the back of the bus. Black T-shirts, headphones, head in a book \u2014 he thinks he's made himself invisible. But not to Eleanor... never to Eleanor.It's really been a while since I last visited Eleanor and Park's story, I even forgot some things here and there. And I always, always forget Eleanor's backstory with Richie, which then makes my heart tighten all anew when I reread it.But let's start at the beginning: Eleanor and Park sitting next to each other on the bus, not talking, not staring. Until one day...\u201cThey still didn\u2019t talk on the bus, but it had become a less confrontational silence. Almost friendly. (But not quite.)Park would have to talk to her today \u2013 to tell her that he didn\u2019t have anything to give her. He\u2019d overslept, then forgotten to grab the stack of comics he\u2019d set out for her the night before. He hadn\u2019t even had time to eat breakfast or brush his teeth, which made him self-conscious, knowing he was going to be sitting so close to her.\u201d\u2018So,\u2019 he said, before he knew what to say next, \u2018you like the Smiths?\u2019 He was careful not to blow his morning breath on her.She looked up, surprised. Maybe confused. He pointed at her book, where she\u2019d written \u2018How Soon Is Now?\u2019 in tall green letters.\u201dAhh, I forgot how much I loved these characters, they're so precious to my heart. Their interactions were so timid (in the best way).Also, can I just mention their first ever meeting because I'm on cloud nine:\u201cBefore he\u2019d even decided to do it, Park scooted toward the window.\u2018Sit down,\u2019 he said. It came out angrily. The girl turned to him, like she couldn\u2019t tell whether he was another jerk or what. \u2018Jesus-fuck,\u2019 Park said softly, nodding to the space next to him, \u2018just sit down.\u2019The girl sat down. She didn\u2019t say anything \u2013 thank God, she didn\u2019t thank him \u2013 and she left six inches of space on the seat between them.Park turned toward the Plexiglas window and waited for a world of suck to hit the fan.\u201dI love the \"Jesus-fuck,\" it's gold.Slowly, steadily, through late-night conversations and an ever-growing stack of mix tapes, Eleanor and Park fall for each other.\u2018You can borrow it,\u2019 he said quietly. \u2018Listen to the rest of the tape.\u2019\u2018I don\u2019t want to break it,\u2019 she said.\u2018You\u2019re not going to break it.\u2019\u2018I don\u2019t want to use up the batteries.\u2019\u2018I don\u2019t care about the batteries.\u2019She looked up at him then, in the eye, maybe for the first time ever. Her hair looked even crazier than it had this morning \u2013 more frizzy than curly, like she was working on a big red afro. But her eyes were dead serious, cold sober. Any clich\u00e9 you\u2019ve ever heard used to describe Clint Eastwood, those were Eleanor\u2019s eyes.\u2018Really,\u2019 she said. \u2018You don\u2019t care.\u2019\u2018They\u2019re just batteries,\u2019 he said.She emptied the batteries and the tape from Park\u2019s Walkman, handed it back to him, then got off the bus without looking back.God, she was weird.\u201dGod, I love those weirdos. And their first conversation on the phone always gets to me:\u2018You can ask me why,\u2019 he said again.\u2018Yeah?\u2019 She sniffed.\u2018Yeah.\u2019\u2018Okay.\u2019 She looked down at the turntable, at her own reflection in the tinted acrylic lid. She looked like a fat-faced ghost. She closed her eyes.\u2018Why do you even like me?\u201dEleanor's question punctured me right in the heart. It reminded me of this scene in My Mad Fat Diary (which is set 10 years after Eleanor and Park), where Rae asks Finn something similar. (Season two was my favorite.)And not only were the romantic aspects of this book described wonderfully, but the familial relationships astonished me.I just find it remarkable how Rainbow Rowell can write both incredibly supportive fathers (Fangirl) and incredibly not supportive fathers (Eleanor & Park). I just... How does one make both work so well???I'll never forgot Richie's awfulness. I mean, what kind of next-level creep writes such horrendous things on someone's books? He's a bastard. A demon. I hate him.(Rebecca Bunch knows what's up.)So when Eleanor formed a close bond with Park\u2019s family, I truly thanked the stars. I mean, it took Park kicking Steve in the head for Eleanor and the family to really connect, but all was good.'I know that your stepdad isn\u2019t an easy man to be around,\u2019 Park\u2019s dad said finally, stepping toward her. \u2018And I\u2019m just saying, you know, that if it\u2019s easier to be over here, then you should just be here. That would make Mindy and I feel a lot better, okay?\u2019\u2018Okay,\u2019 she said.\u2018So this is the last time I\u2019m going to ask you to stay for dinner.\u2019Eleanor smiled, and he smiled back, and for a second he looked a lot more like Park than Tom Selleck.\u201dI loved seeing her happy.And speaking of happy... I completely adored Eleanor and Park's first kiss (maybe a little too much).Source'I\u2019ve never done this before,\u2019 she said.\u2018S\u2019okay,\u2019 he said.\u2018It\u2019s not, it\u2019s going to be terrible.\u2019He shook his head. \u2018It\u2019s not.\u2019She shook her head a little more. Just a little. \u2018You\u2019re going to regret this,\u2019 she said.That made him laugh, so he had to wait a second before he kissed her.It wasn\u2019t terrible. Eleanor\u2019s lips were soft and warm, and he could feel her pulse in her cheek. It was good that she was so nervous \u2013 because it forced him not to be. It steadied him to feel her trembling.He pulled away before he wanted to. He hadn\u2019t done this enough to know how to breathe.When he pulled away, her eyes were mostly closed. His grandparents had a light on, on their front porch, and Eleanor\u2019s face caught every bit of it. She looked like she should be married to the man in the moon.\u201d\u201cHe pulled her closer and kissed the top her head. He tried to find her ear under all that hair.\u2018Come here,\u2019 he said, \u2018I want to show you something.\u2019She laughed.

She was just trying to get through the night.\u201dThat last sentence is still breaking my heart.So I was extremely grateful when we got some closure on the kids:\u201cWhen he got sick of his bedroom, when there was nothing left in his life that smelled like vanilla \u2013 Park walked by Eleanor\u2019s house.Sometimes the truck was there, sometimes it wasn\u2019t, sometimes the Rottweiler was asleep on the porch.

Something heavy and winged took off from his chest.Eleanor hadn\u2019t written him a letter, it was a postcard.Just three words long.\u201dOkay, so I've had years to think about what my guess is for the three words, and I keep coming back to: 'I miss you.'It's very casual, no strings, no obligations.What's your guess for the three words?*Note: I'm an Amazon Affiliate.

Heartwarming and heartbreaking all at the same time! I wasn't expecting to care so much about these characters and their relationship but I was completely caught up in this story. It's told in 3rd-person past tense, which I sometimes have trouble connecting with, but not so in this case! I feel like I really know both Eleanor and Park, and I love them both separately but I especially love them together. It seemed like their relationship shouldn't work, but it does, so well. I was grinning like an idiot while reading because I was just so giddy over their blooming romance. I could feel how much they cared for each other like it was oozing off the page.Overall, I loved this book--the characters, the romance, the writing and just the way everything unfolded so beautifully and felt so real. One of the best contemporary novels I've read in a while! DEFINITELY RECOMMENDED!"}, {"Review": "years after everyone else, i have finally read this book. and now i'm all caught up on the zeitgeist! phew. and damn, now i understand why rainbow rowell is so beloved. i mean, i read Fangirl and thought it was excellent, but this one, while it is not as good as Fangirl, does a couple of things so freaking well that it gave me all the swoons and the swirls. rainbow rowell has this ability to tap into the teenage experience that is a little spooky. and while john green gets all the credit for being the author that writes the contemporary YA novels sophisticated enough to convert stubborn adult readers into YA fans, i think this book is more faithful to the realities of teenlife than his. green's characters are winning and funny and smart and articulate, and they have appeal coming out their ears, but they're a little idealized - too knowing, too confident, too much like miniaturized adults. rowell remembers the rough edges, the uncertainty, and her characters are a puddle of messy contradictions and still-developing personalities. and this, to me, makes them even more appealing because they channel all sorts of messy nostalgia for my dumb teen self.the best thing about this book is not even the love story because love-schmove. but goddamn, the way she writes about falling in love with music is astonishing. all the making of heartfelt mix tapes for other people, the way certain lyrics can stop your heart, the doodling of band names and songs - not the ones you love, but the ones you want to love - that drive to investigate the bands you encounter through chance and want to remember to check out as part of some teenage rite of passage - that was a perfect scene. this book did for me what The Perks of Being a Wallflower apparently does for other people. it slices off a moment in time and pop culture that is so essential and precious and you can just feel the pulse of musical revelation. and i don't want to be one of these old fogies that says to the kids, \"your music is overproduced and soulless. in MY day\u2026\" but it's true. there is no joy purer than a teenager discovering the smiths. the other amazing, perfect thing, and it's such a small moment, but when - (view spoiler)[ tina finds eleanor running through the streets while richie is out prowling for her in his car, and assesses the situation so quickly and accurately, it's just a perfect moment of teenage solidarity. such an acknowledgment of \"we are not friends, but i understand what you're up against and i have your back.\" it's a perfect encapsulation of that whole \"us against them\" attitude that pervades teen movies from the 80's - the legacy of john hughes. the moment tina whispers \"car,\" killed me. I WAS KILLED! such a small thing to kill me, but it did. i could see that scene so vividly, and while to most people it was probably just a throwaway moment in between the meat of the story, for me it was the entire book. (hide spoiler)]i mean, it's not a perfect novel. there's a lot crammed into here, and it can get to feeling a little claustrophobic with all the competing \"problem\" narratives and underdeveloped secondary characters. there are a lot of unexplored storylines and opportunities to develop situations that weren't and a narrower focus might have made this more powerful overall. but even though it can feel a little overstuffed, it doesn't detract from the novel. the most complimentary thing i can say about a book is that it is honest. not necessarily realistic or authentic, but honest. and i guess we gotta talk about the romance parts. since that's kind of the whole point of the book, as little interest as i usually have in YA romance novels. for all my eye-rolling over teen romance, this book captures all the feels and the consuming nature of young love and its hollow devouring obsession. and it's handled in a smart way. after eleanor pooh-poohs romeo and juliet as \u2026two rich kids who've always gotten every little thing they want and dismisses the play as shakespeare \"making fun of love,\" the less-cynical park hesitantly pinpoints the appeal of romeo and juliet:\"\u2026because people want to remember what it's like to be young? And in love?\"and that's probably why this book, and other YA romances, are popular with older readers. because while no one (hopefully) ever claims that romeo and juliet's (spoiler alert) five-day infatuation/suicide pact brings back memories of their own teenage love lives, this book sorta does. perfect example: eleanor and park's \"first contact\" moment when he realizes that any sort of romantic dalliance before this was unsatisfying and meaningless playacting and that the missing element of excitement in the experimentation wasn't a lack in himself, but a lack of emotional attraction and now he \"gets\" it.Or maybe, he thought now, he just didn't recognize all those other girls. The way a computer drive will spit out a disk if it doesn't recognize the formatting.When he touched Eleanor's hand, he recognized her. He knew. i mean, an adorably nerdy way to phrase it, but definitely relatable. i think the writing of eleanor was much stronger than the writing of park. the whole \"outsider\" romance thing was a little uneven to me. i understand what sets her apart - she's \"big\" and constantly comparing herself to the adult beauty of her mother, she comes from a damaged home, she dresses like a hobo clown, she's socially awkward, etc, but as for park, he's what - half asian? and that's a problem? i mean, it's mentioned that his dad thinks he's a pussy and that people don't think asian guys are hot, but he's reasonably popular and athletic and girls like him and he seems cool as shit. so his half of the \"outsider\" dynamic seems forced. but it might just be me not relating to the perceived stigma against asian guys - one of my first crushes was on data from the goonies because - adorable:and maybe in omaha in the 80's, people didn't think asian dudes were hot, but i don't think park would have much trouble getting a girl on racial grounds today, right?(i might be the only one with a crush on b.d. wong, but whatever.)and once you start adding the eyeliner?? yeah, i am all aboard the park train. and for that matter, i don't think redheads with big boobs are frowned upon much, either. it gets better, kids. it really does. but until it does, go listen to the smiths.come to my blog!"}, {"Review": "I have so many thoughts and ideas and things I want to discuss, and I can't possible put them all here, but here are some of my main thinkings:1) PARENTS: Parent's are such an integral part of teenage life - they are the reason you can do things, the reason you can't do things, the reason you have money, etc. This book had parents that were just as important, interesting, and developed as the main characters and I so appreciated that. I especially enjoyed Park's parents: they were so complex and confused about their son, but ultimately so supportive.2) ODDBALLS: I love that basically every character in this book was weird and quirky and individual. I could imagine so many imperfections in everybody, they felt so real. 3) PARK: Guys, I love Park. He had a handful of not-so-honourable moments, but he owned up to them, he felt bad about them, and he tried his best to overcome them. He was so glorious. So very very glorious. #TeamPark4) EYELINER: I loved the eyeliner. So much. Park owned it, he embraced it, and it caused trouble in his house but it was worth it. And later on we see him using it more smudge-ingly, and just brilliant.5) THAT ENDING: Woah. Woahhh. When Eleanor went to her bed and everything clicked into place.. from that moment on we were in such a dangerous and nervous place. I felt genuine fear and concern for everyone. It was intense! The ACTUAL ending was kind of cliff-hangery.. I think the ending makes perfect sense, it's very realistic, but that doesn't mean I don't want a sequel ;)"}, {"Review": "3.8/5 Stars \u2b50\ufe0f \u2b50\ufe0f \u2b50\ufe0f \u2b50\ufe0f\u201cEleanor was right. She never looked nice. She looked like art, and art wasn't supposed to look nice; it was supposed to make you feel something.\u201d Wait a fucking minute. There are no more pages? It just ended... like that? Rainbow Rowell, why do me like this? Do you not love your readers? Why would you leave it hanging there? I NEED CLOSURE. OR MAYBE A SECOND BOOK. Or a movie. Who the fuck knows? I know I'm dying right now.Set over the course of one school year in 1986, this is the story of two star-crossed misfits-smart enough to know that first love almost never lasts, but brave and desperate enough to try. When Eleanor meets Park, you'll remember your own first love-and just how hard it pulled you under.This book had flaws. Flaws I couldn't not see. But let's look first at everything. The writing. Rainbow Rowell is an exceptional writer. The way she writes is engaging to the point you can't leave the book down. She creates realistic situations and characters that you can relate to and want to punch and love and hate and loathe and adore. I have read one other of her books, Fangirl and her writing in this one was different than that. Her writing in Eleanor & Park was poetic, unique and pretentious. More than John Green pretentious. But this was an aspect I adored, it added something to the book, to the characters, to the time and the depth of the situations. For some reason I will never understand, she made me think of the characters as too young or too old. Never their actual age. This is probably only me, but at certain situations they seemed too childish and at other too mature. Their real age didn't show for me. But that's probably just me.I really enjoyed Eleanor and Park's romance, even though it was stretched out at points. Their relationship was special, they made each other better, they loved each other deeply. But it was destructive as well. At the point of them ditching their friends to be with each other. Or how jealous Eleanor got over nothing. Or how mad she got at him for saying the most minor shit. Honestly I felt that some situations between them were too dramatic for no reason. Some lines spoken between them, and also lines or thoughts that were completely unnecessary and didn't add anything to the plot. Sometimes I cringed without wanting to, I'm sorry. You all might find these lines extremely romantic but I'm not a romantic person. Mostly.I quite enjoyed the rawness of the situations. The bullying, the domestic abuse, the fat shaming, the racism, all of these real life situations this book brought to light. Especially, because they were more prominent at that time. Furthermore, I adored how after everything that happened, the jocks and the bullies helped Eleanor. And Steve didn't bully Park for his eyeliner. I loved that this showed how people can change or they can be misunderstood easily. For example, when Eleanor found out Tana wasn't writing this filthy shit on her books.This book was full of references... fucking full of references. It's to be expected, anything written in the 21st century about the 80s is always full with references. TV and film as well. It's like they want to show how much they know about that time. And that we didn't live then to understand. So they're just throwing references around fucking everywhere without even needing them to be there to show their spectacular knowledge. We get it. You're old af. The jokes will go over out little heads, as it is to be expected. Fuck off. I don't hold this against the author, obviously, it's a nice way to make us get the vibe of the time but the audience this book is targeted at won't understand a thing. But she has no choice. I get it. And older people will read this book, I suppose. And younger people understand these references. I suppose.In conclusion, I loved this book okay? I finished it in two fucking days, for God's sake. Yes, it was flawed, yes, it was too much at times, yes, the ending left me hanging for more, but I loved it. Books are supposed to be flawed. Like real life and real people are.

It's not that I don't like y'all; it's just that I'd rather spend my time talking about books that I actually, ya know, like.I have thought about Eleanor & Park everyday since I read it two months ago.That\u2019s not a compliment.In some respects, my attitude is perhaps not terribly fair because a particular aspect of Eleanor and Park elicited a visceral reaction from me that is personal to me, a reaction that a lot of people would not have or understand.But as I\u2019ve thought about the novel over the past two months, mulling over the possibility that I was perhaps being too sensitive, that the possibility of my being too sensitive was unfairly impacting my view of the rest of the book, and the book as a whole, my final analysis has always been the same: I don\u2019t believe this book.I don\u2019t believe the historical context.I don\u2019t believe the characters.I don\u2019t believe the romance.Let\u2019s start with the first issue, the historical context.Eleanor and Park is framed as a historical novel, taking place in Omaha, Nebraska, the author Rainbow Rowell\u2019s hometown, in 1986. Our titular 16-year-old characters meet on the school bus when Park grudgingly allows new kid Eleanor to share his seat. Park is half-Korean, his parents having met and married in South Korea, where his father was stationed as a member of the army. Hmmmmm. Okay, so they met around 1968? 1969? I have to assume it was no later than 1969 since as a sixteen year old in 1986, Park would have to have been born in 1970. So...during the height of the Vietnam War, when a draft was in place to send as many young men as possible into the fray, Park\u2019s father, an able-bodied member of the U.S. military was...stationed at an army base in Korea. Possible, I suppose, but still a bit ludicrous to me.Ok, so then his parents get married and move to his father\u2019s hometown of Omaha, Nebraska where Park is raised and, according to Park, the good people of Omaha,\u201c...couldn\u2019t call him a freak or a [anti-Asian slur] or a [homosexual slur], because\u2014well, first, because his dad was a giant and a veteran and from the neighborhood.\u201dLet me get this straight. Park\u2019s interracial family faces minimal racial prejudice in the midwestern United States, an area known for lacking in diversity, during the 1970s and 1980s. Park\u2019s Korean mother and Caucasian father married and lived happily with their biracial children, facing little racism in Omaha, Nebraska starting in 1970, less than 30 years after United States citizens of Japanese descent were forced into internment camps during World War II, less than twenty years after the Korean War took 36,516 American lives, only seven years after interracial marriage was legalized in the state of Nebraska, only three years after the U.S. Supreme Court struck down all other anti-miscegenation laws throughout the country via their Loving v. Virginia decision, only two years after the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. and the height of the Civil Rights Movement, and smack-dab in the middle of the controversial Vietnam war, which made villains out of members of the military who served in it upon their stateside returns and caused a swell of anti-Asian sentiment throughout the country.I call bullshit.Furthermore, while a version of racism does appear in the novel in the form of bad kung-fu jokes and \u201cYou are Asian therefore you must be Chinese\u201d assumptions, it seems deliberately placed within the historical framework. As Rainbow Rowell stated in a Publisher\u2019s Weekly interview,\u201cThe neighborhood Eleanor and Park live in is the neighborhood I grew up in. And at that time, it was white and racist.\u201dTherefore, the author was attempting to portray racism as it was, as if that racism is limited to that time frame. Unfortunately, as I discussed at length during our first podcast, that 1986 version of racism is alive and well in 2013, and I seriously resent the placement of it in a historical novel as if it no longer exists today. So, while Eleanor and Park was conveniently accurate as far as pop culture, cutely peppered with nostalgia-inducing references of many 80s bands and comic books, I found the historical context extremely shallow and unconvincing. In addition to being devoid of so many of the broader, deeper societal issues of the time, the context also wrongly and paradoxically relegated issues that still gnaw at the framework of our current society to history.Moving on the the characters: I never deeply connected to either of them, despite having much in common with both of the main characters.While the third person past tense POV that switched from Eleanor and Park\u2019s perspectives throughout the novel made sense for the story, it also seemed to create a barrier that did not allow me to experience what the characters were going through or how they felt with immediacy or intensity. Considering how much I could relate both of the characters, the disconnect struck me as especially odd.I know what it\u2019s like to be relentlessly bullied in school for weeks, months on end. I know what it\u2019s like to have to walk on eggshells in what is supposed to be the safety of home, and I understand the undercurrent of fear that results from knowing that walking on said eggshells doesn\u2019t guarantee safety from someone else\u2019s volatile temper. I know what it\u2019s like to have ridiculous racial stereotypes thrown in my face on a regular basis. And yet, when I encountered these situations in Eleanor and Park, I felt nothing more than a mild discomfort as I felt my own memories merely tickle at the edge of my awareness, rather than force their way to the forefront and mirror whatever provocations Eleanor or Park happened to be enduring at that point of the book. Moreover, while Eleanor and Park are on the surface atypical YA characters, I still found their life circumstances portrayed in a way that did not allow me to take them seriously.For instance, at the beginning of the book, Eleanor has just moved back in with her family after having been kicked out by her stepfather and spending a year at a friend\u2019s house. During that time, her family moved to a different house, in which the bathroom has no door and she has to share a tiny bedroom with her four younger siblings. Her stepfather is an abusive alcoholic, her biological father is a deadbeat who doesn\u2019t pay his child support, thereby making her mom stereotyped abuse victim 101. Catie from the Readventurer aptly noted in our podcast comments that she appreciated the novelty of a poor, struggling caucasian character in Eleanor.While it\u2019s true that the poor, struggling characters in YA books tend to be boys and/or minorities, Eleanor\u2019s troubles in the book, by having bullying AND abuse AND alcoholism AND poverty all crammed in there, struck me as caricatures, rather than authentic struggles. I know it may be hard to believe, but sometimes not all of these issues happen simultaneously in real life. Sometimes parents are assholes without the fuel of alcohol. Sometimes they\u2019re abusers without the frustration of poverty. Sometimes they\u2019re poor AND *gasp* good, hardworking people! Additionally, as I also spoke about at length during our first podcast, I found Park\u2019s character, which had so much potential for nuance, to be flat as a freshly zambonied ice rink. First of all, I do not understand how he could not be somewhat aware of the issues surrounding Eleanor\u2019s crapfest of a home life. I get teenage self-absorption and all, but the obviousness of the situation combined with his obliviousness made him look like a moron. Furthermore, rather than have him deal with the intangible struggle of being caught in between two very different cultures and value systems between his Korean-born mother and American surroundings, the author instead has Park spend his time whinging about his insecurities over his Korean appearance. He is ashamed of his mother\u2019s accent. He blames his short height on his Korean genes. He fears his white dad looks at him as effeminate because he looks more Korean than his younger brother Josh. He is jealous of his brother because Josh barely looks Korean at all. As a Korean-American, I found this simplistic attitude that portrays being a minority solely as a negative solely based on racial appearance shallow, offensive and frustrating because this type of poor depiction has been going on for my whole life, repeatedly, in every cultural medium. I suppose it would be easy to assume that every minority in the US wishes they could just snap their fingers and be white, but the reality is far more complicated. Rainbow Rowell had a huge opportunity to explore these intricacies via Park\u2019s character, and Park\u2019s mom, for that matter, but clearly did not do her research, and therefore did not deliver.Ultimately, I found could not buy into what is supposed the be the focal point of the book, which is the romance (more like romance?) between Eleanor and Park.I did find the framework of the romantic development, in which the Eleanor and Park slowly connect on the school bus via the sharing of mixtapes and comic books, novel and charming. But, the 180 degree contrast of Eleanor\u2019s home life to Park\u2019s financially stable, loving home life felt like a forced, exaggerated version of Pretty in Pink, which as a movie is charming but never struck me as realistic. And because I never felt like the book delved into either character in a deep manner, which limited the character development, which limited the relationship development, I was unable to believe in the all-consuming teenage love that Rainbow Rowell tried to portray.However, even though I found myself incredibly let down by Eleanor and Park, due in large part to the lack of proper research and context into cultural and historical issues that I find quite important, especially for what is termed a historical novel, I still harbor optimism for any of Rainbow Rowell\u2019s future works.As a huge fan of Rowell\u2019s previously published book, Attachments, which utterly charmed me with its portrayal of vivid connections between characters who don\u2019t interact in person as well as convinced me of the 1990s setting, I look forward to being delighted by her writing once again because I am convinced that it will happen.\nFNL Character Rating: J.D. McCoy: Cute on the surface, initially promising, but ultimately a huge disappointment that I\u2019d love to forget but can\u2019t because he was so darned infuriating.\n"}, {"Review": "I know I said I wasn't going to do a review, because I feel that my status updates are pretty telling enough, but...First, I just don't see Park's parents as a good example of a couple that \"made it\" against all odds, as John Green implies. There is NOTHING in this book about how or why they fell in love. As an Asian woman, I look at it through a more disbelieving lens. It sounds like a white man \"saving\" an Asian woman from her \"poor,\" \"lower-rung,\" \"terrible\" life. She is basically forced to assimilate into this new culture (they live in OMAHA, for Chrissakes) and her children don't even know anything about her - not her background, her family, the life she left...! My God! There is, apparently, no attempt on the part of her white husband, either, to understand her culture or to preserve it at all. I get that I'm coming from a really skeptical position, but honestly, from what I (and many other Asian women) know about \"interracial\" couples, it is entirely with good reason. The whole thing reminds me of \"creepy white guys with Asian fetishes.\" It's really unsettling.Additionally... abuse is a big part of this novel, but the way Rainbow Rowell addresses it strikes me as so odd. The book is literally a split between violence and emotional abuse, and this gushy overwhelming \"love\" between two fifteen-year-old kids. At one point, Park is actually HURT that Eleanor has fallen asleep on the car instead of talking to him, which I still find kind of gross and shocking. Like, dude. She's running away from her abusive rapist stepfather. She's got more to worry about than hurting your poor feelings.Overall, I just felt like there wasn't much going for this book. There was no true plot - the only things that really had an ongoing story line were (a) the emotionally abusive notes on Eleanor's textbooks, which weren't even truly addressed until the very last minute, and (b) Eleanor and Park's relationship, which didn't seem sincere to me. I mean, the two things that united them (comics and music) turned into throwaway items that became kind of irrelevant to their story, not even halfway through.Plus... I don't know, there was just so much casual racism in this book, and not in a really self-aware way. It made me really uncomfortable reading this, but I don't know what else to expect, given that the author is a white woman from Nebraska, trying to embed a culture - of which she is not even a part, as far as I know - into a complex story that wasn't even remotely fleshed out."}, {"Review": "\n\u2018You\u2019re not the Han Solo in this relationship, you know.\u2019\u2018I\u2019m totally the Han Solo,\u2019 she whispered. \u2018You can be Han Solo,\u2019 he said, \u2018And I\u2019ll be Boba Fett.

The characters\u2026 the characters are nearly everything good about this world crammed into two human beings who fit together like puzzle pieces. This book is essentially a love story so I didn\u2019t expect to see so much beyond it terms of family drama, high school drama, and just so many more feelings that were not romantic in nature.I love that the blurb is so vague about the characters and what is going to happen, but after you finish reading the book you look at the blurb and think \u2018that\u2019s where it all started\u2019. I started reading the book without reading the blurb, but this book\u2019s blurb unlike a lot others reveals just how much it needs to, so if you\u2019re not among the six hundred thousand people who have read it on goodreads so far, don\u2019t hesitate to read the blurb or the masterpiece that this book is.Eleanor and Park have fundamentally very different lives and watching their individual stories collide in this stunning explosion was nothing but eventful. At first glance their personalities are so different and their upbringing so varied, but then you keep reading and you start seeing these minute similarities in the way they think and that their different personalities just serve to emphasize how well matched they are.\nAnd when Eleanor smiled, something broke inside of him.Something always did.\n I love that Rainbow Rowell did not try to write a love story that was either too smooth or too complicated. She found the perfect combination of the two and landed somewhere in the middle. She did not cover up the bumps, the misunderstandings, and the awkwardness. The doubts, the repercussions, and the embarrassment. But she did not linger on them for too long either. She created two of the best characters in the world and let them sing in a world of hardship and disappointment, but one that still allowed them to find love. It is story of friendship, bullies, pain, fright, love, need, and comfort tinged with just a bit of hysteria. \nThe world rebuilt itself into a better place around him. \nYou know, after you finish reading the book you look back at a story so straightforward yet so complex in all the ways in which it mattered. You look back a t the cutest love story taking place in the lives of two amazing souls in a world that might might never truly support them. I personally look back at everything and wonder how I survived something so marvelous."}, {"Review": "UPDATE 2017: Look at my new special edition of the book! I love it so much! The inside pages on front and back are awesome. I love the new cover too \u2665http://melissa413readsalot.blogspot.c...They met on the bus.Eleanor was the new girl, the girl with the vibrant red hair, the one everyone made fun of, but if they only knew what she had to go through at home. Park is the quiet boy that just wants to be left a lone to do his own thing. He's the only one that would let Eleanor sit down. Park shared his comics and music with Eleanor. She enjoyed them almost as much as Park did. They both became closer and closer on their talks to and from school on the bus. Then......From all of the talks about comics, superheroes, villains, mixed tapes, and mean people.. they started to fall in love. Eleanor has one sister and three brothers, they live with their mom and stepdad. The stepdad is a horrible person and they live in even more horrible conditions. I feel sad for them and wish their mom would man up and find a way to get her kids away from that jerk :( \u2663\u2663\u2663\u2663\u2663So, yeah I have a terrible stepdad, and I don't have a phone, and sometimes when we're out of dish soap, I have to wash my hair with flea and tick shampoo....\u2663\u2663\u2663\u2663\u2663Eleanor's real dad didn't want any of them any more, he puts in an appearance in the book, a short one. I liked how Eleanor described her parents to Park. It was sad, but funny.. \u2663\u2663\u2663\u2663\u2663\"Is this the kind of scintillating conversation we're going to have now that we don't have any secrets?\"\"Yes. Is your mom Danish?\"\"Yes,\" she said. \"What's your dad?\"\"An ass.\"He frowned. \"What? You wanted honest and intimate. That's way more honest than 'Scottish.'\"\u2663\u2663\u2663\u2663\u2663Park has pretty nice parents and a crazy brother, wait, two brothers. Their dad has had them in martial arts since they were little. He seems tough at first but I grew to love him toward the end. And Park's mom is half Korean and I felt the same about her in the beginning, then she turned out all right :) I really liked the book. I was sad at the way Eleanor was bullied and her home life. I loved her and Park and some of the other characters in the story. I just wish the ending could have been a little bit better :( But this is high school and crazy things happen. I will say I am proud to announce that I did not cry during this book :) Almost there for a minute, but nope. For once, I was okay with the crying :)"}, {"Review": "for people who saw my original review, I want to say I still 100% stand by everything I said. the reason I'm deleting it is because, as a white reviewer, I didn't want to talk over East Asians who have reviewed this book and talked about why it was racist.

I just wasn't that into the romance and I really hated the ending. I just found Eleanor and Park to compltely fit that trope of being the \"Edgy kids who are different\" and I really hate that trope. Plus I found the plot twist about who's writing on Eleanor's books really uncomfortable and it just didn't sit right with me in how it was portrayed. I did like ! the music stuff. I found it real cute maybe because I real love Joy Division and it featured heavily so that was cute. \nI JUST DON'T LIKE THIS BOOK\n and if you do, that's fine! But you can like something and ALSO be critical of it's flaws. In my original review/comments it got, I was stunned about how many people were more offended about something being called racist then they were about the book being racist.

ENJOY CONTENT CRITICALLY."}, {"Review": "5 stars! \n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re my favorite person of all time.\u201d\n\n\u2028Eleanor & Park\u2026 this has been sitting on my kindle for a year. HOW has this been just sitting on my kindle for a year??? First off, I\u2019m going to say if you have this book, don\u2019t let it just sit on your kindle. Read it, listen to it, whatever. Just make sure you don\u2019t overlook this one. It\u2019s a book that deserves to be read. These are some of the most special characters and Rainbow Rowell writes some of the best YA ever. So read the book.\nEleanor is a young girl who\u2019s had a rough life. Not only at home, but school. She\u2019s a little awkward, has red hair, clothes that don\u2019t flatter her, and people at school call her \u2018Big Red\u2019. But things at school aren\u2019t near as bad as things at her home. Eleanor\u2019s story broke my heart. But then, something changes for her. She sits on the bus next to a boy named Park. And her life is forever different. Park is one of the greatest and most lovable heroes I\u2019ve ever read about. This sixteen year old boy sees past all the awkward that is Eleanor. He sees the real her. They develop a friendship based on music, comics, and a mutual respect for one another. That friendship is what Eleanor lives for. And as time passes, Park too. Their friendship turns into so much more. \n\nNothing was dirty. With Park. Nothing could be shameful. Because Park was the sun, and that was the only way Eleanor could think to explain it.\n I loved the dual pov in this story. Getting in both Eleanor and Parks head was a real treat. For as serious as some of the subject matter was, my heart was so happy listening to this. These two characters were both nothing short of amazing. And Park\u2019s family was pretty fantastic too. I just loved them both so much. Together, their relationship was so special and beautiful. I listened to this on audio and I loved the narration. I actually didn\u2019t get much reading done at all this week because every time I went to read a book, I stopped and pushed play on my audible app. I was more interested in the world of Eleanor & Park than anything else I was reading. The ending\u2026 at first I wasn\u2019t happy with that ending. In fact, I almost deducted some points because of it (but lets be real, I can\u2019t possibly give this book less than 5 stars- who am I kidding). The more I think about it, the more I think of the possibilities and I guess I\u2019ll just have to be happy with the way things were left and use my imagination.Eleanor & Park is an epic story of friendship, love, loyalty and acceptance. It\u2019s emotional, beautiful, heart warming and even heart breaking at times but its\u2019 a book that needs to be experienced. It really is a profound tale of two teens who have to deal with so much more than the average kids. You need to meet these characters and hear their story. A new book on my favorites list- thanks Jen (yet again), for the fantastic rec! \n\n\n\u201cNothing before you counts. And I can\u2019t even imagine an after.\u201d\n\n"}, {"Review": "Wow! There was so much about this book that I really loved. 'Eleanor & Park' was touching and beautiful in it's simplicity. This book captured the essence of first love and the perils of high school, while also tackling some serious issues, like abuse.I listened to the Audible version and I have to give kudos to the narrator(s). The narration was extremely well done. The voices of the characters really drew you in and made you feel like you were right there in the moment with the characters. It says a lot about the narration when it can pull you into a story so completely.As I was listening to this story, my heart broke for Eleanor. She had such a horrible home life and her school life wasn't any better. The poor girl couldn't escape bullying wherever she went. I felt so bad for her as she tried to navigate her difficult teenage years while trying to stand proud in the face of such cruelty. She was so smart, but trapped by the life she was dealt.Park's life stood out in stark contrast to Eleanor's. He was raised in a home that was pretty much \"ideal\". Of course, he had the typical teenage concerns and conflict with his parents. However, his petty problems only served to highlight how fortunate he was to have loving parents when contrasted with Eleanor's reality.Although Park initially avoided any association with Eleanor, succumbing to peer pressure, he eventually opened up to the girl that sat beside him on the school bus. That took a great deal of bravery on his part. Let's face it, teenagers can be very cruel. Park risked joining Eleanor at the bottom of the social hierarchy when he decided to go against the grain and be kind to her. Little by little, they formed a friendship. Eventually, that friendship grew into more. Park became the single most positive part of Eleanor's daily life. He was the only person that showed her concern and treated her kindly. As the two grew closer, his family also served as a safe haven for Eleanor. For these reasons, I grew to love Park also.This is a coming of age story and a story of first love. Rainbow Rowell managed to transport me right back to high school. Everyone who has been a teenager can relate to the experiences and emotions of these characters. This is the type of story that serves to remind us of the consequences of our actions and the effect of our words. From start to finish, I was enthralled with 'Eleanor & Park'. I was sure that this would be a 5-star read for me right up until about the 90% mark. Then, the story ended rather abruptly and I was left wanting. I couldn't believe that the author that wrote such a beautiful story would end it in that way. It just didn't seem fair or right. After everything, I was furious to see it close in the manner it did. Overall, it was still a fabulous story. I won't lie. I hated the way that the story ended. I just don't need my fiction to be that true to life. In fairness, the ending doesn't seem to be an issue for most of my friends that have read this book. For me, it was upsetting enough to knock a star off the rating. The ending wrecked me and I went in search of a second book or an extra something that would provide closure. It didn't happen and I'm still reeling. So, I loved it....right up until the ending.Check out more of my reviews at www.bookaddicthaven.com "}, {"Review": "This book was everything I've been searching for since Anna and the French Kiss. It gave me that melty, clenchy feeling in my chest, the warm fuzzies in my stomach. I was basically a mess throughout the entire thing. These two characters had my emotions going up and down like someone was beating on them with one of those sledgehammers at a carnival, trying to get them to climb to the top of that lit up pole again and again. And every time I thought they couldn't go any higher, Park would do or say something else that sent me flying up, up, up...In this book, it's 1986 and Eleanor's life isn't easy. She's one of five children to a mother who's married to a grade-A jerkface, and a father who just doesn't seem to care at all. After being kicked out of her mom's house once, she's back home now, crammed into a tiny bedroom with her four siblings, and stuck using a bathroom that doesn't even have a door. Her family doesn't have a lot of money. She doesn't even have shampoo. But she's tough, because she's learned how to be. She doesn't really have any other choice.On her first day of school, it's Park who--somewhat grudgingly--shares his seat on the bus with her. Which is just the beginning of what becomes an incredible story of first love. After sitting on the bus together day after day, they bond over comic books and mix tapes and kicks to the face and even makeup. He says things like this to her:He set his forehead against hers. She didn\u2019t know what to do with her eyes or her hands. \u201cNothing before you counts,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I can\u2019t even imagine an after.\u201dAND THIS:\u201cYou can be Han Solo,\u201d he said, kissing her throat. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll be Boba Fett. I\u2019ll cross the sky for you.\u201dGAH. I cannot with him. Can. Not. He's definitely top-five-book-boy material. I don't think I've ever flailed so hard over a simple hand holding scene, but damnit, I did. Again with the sledgehammers.Sadly, as Park and Eleanor learn the hard way, sometimes not all first loves are meant to be forever loves... or are they? ;)(view spoiler)[The end of this book left me in tears. Like, legit streaming down my face, stuttering, had to get up and leave the room so my husband wouldn't think I was crazy, tears. Any book that can do that usually goes straight to my favorites pile, but I'll admit, I knocked this one down a star because this ending--though it made sense--was...kind of unfulfilling. I wanted more! Just a little bit. I wanted her to CALL HIM. I wanted her to write him back! I just wanted more. Just a teensy, tiny, little bit. Open ended endings aren't my favorite, and though what I'm left with tells me I can picture a happy ending for these two kids...I still question whether or not it actually happened if the author doesn't tell me herself. I need it spelled out, okay? I don't like wondering! Basically, it was a bit of a disappointment after all my happy-swoony-puddly feelings from the beginning. BUT... I almost don't even mind because I loved the rest so much. (hide spoiler)]"}, {"Review": "1.5/5 stars\nDNF at page 195\n\nApologies in advance to anyone who liked this book. This is simply my opinion.\nLooks like it's time for another unnecessarily long gif-filled rant review, folks. My friends, after this book: Me, after this book:Never have I ever been happier to check a book out from the library. Did I even read the same book as everyone else? I was expecting a swoon-worthy misfit love story. Did I get that? Nope. I got whiny characters and angst. A lot of angst. Seriously, a more appropriate title for this book would be \"Angst & Daddy Issues.\"I love Rainbow Rowell, I really do. Carry On and Fangirl are two of my favourite stand-alones - they made me laugh, flail, even tear up a little. Eleanor & Park just made me annoyed and confused. I didn't care about these characters - at all. And believe me, I care deeply about the well-being of fictional characters. But these characters....I didn't care about Eleanor, or Park, or their family, or the plot, or, more accurately, the lack of plot. All I could think was:Which is probably what everyone is going to think about my unpopular opinion, sorry.There was one scene that made me think I was falling for these characters, but after that, everything I thought was, \"How many pages do I have left?\" or \"When are things going to start getting good?\" That should've tipped me off right then and there that I was not going to enjoy this. You see, I typically give a book 100 pages before I decide if I like it or not. I gave Eleanor & Park roughly 200 pages before I decided I couldn't take much more of this. Dear, Eleanor:Eleanor annoyed me so much. So much. I hate characters who are indecisive and constantly contradict themselves in any way, shape, or form - and that was Eleanor in a nutshell. Look. I get it. She's had a rough life. The kids at school write horrible things on her notebooks. Her step-father is a dick. But that shouldn't be an excuse to constantly take your anger out on your boyfriend, who did nothing to you. You know that song by Katy Perry? The one where she says \"you change your mind like a girl changes clothes?\" Yeah, that song is basically Eleanor's anthem. To me, this book seemed a bit insta-lovey. Sure, they hated each other at first, but their relationship was so aggravating and rushed.Weirdly enough, one reason I didn't like the book was because it took place in the 80's. How stupid is that? It's a ridiculous reason to dislike a book. But it still bugged me, nonetheless. Will I ever come back to this book? Maybe. But as of right now:"}, {"Review": "I need to state right away that YA is not one of my favorite genres: I hated the Twilight books, I'm not a fan of paranormal romance and I've been avoiding the flood of YA dystopian novels. I want this to be clear because if you like YA, than my negative reaction maybe won't apply to you. You may love this book, as many others already have.I wanted to read this novel because it received several glowing reviews and it was being compared to John Green's The Fault in Our Stars, which I really liked. Eleanor & Park is set in a high school in Omaha in 1986. The titular characters are teenagers who meet on the school bus -- Eleanor dresses weird and is new at the school; Park is biracial and tries to keep his head down so he won't get picked on. The two bond over comic books and music and fall into puppy love. My main complaint is that Rowell tried putting 10 pounds of plot into a 5-pound bag. As if the outsiders-fall-in-love story wasn't enough, she gave Eleanor a hellish home life: her stepfather is abusive, neglectful and had previously kicked her out of the house for standing up to him. Meanwhile, Park, whose father is white and his mother is Korean, feels like a \"pussy\" compared to his ex-military dad, who yells at him a lot. Much of this family stuff didn't ring true to me and it felt so forced that I had to do a lot of skimming to survive the home scenes. Of course, I also had to skim a lot of the school scenes because the dialogue of the teens felt so contrived.And then there are all the retro pop culture references -- never for a page does Rowell let you forget that the story is set in 1986. OK, OK, we get it already.But what really made me want to heave this book across the room was the ping-pong writing style. Rowell wrote very short sections, bouncing back and forth and back and forth between Eleanor and Park's point of view. It is the perfect example of how limited the modern attention span is that writers think the only way a young person will read something is if it's in short posts.I think Eleanor & Park was trying to do too much and ended up being bad at all of it. There are so many other books that do all of these elements better. For young love, I really liked John Green's The Fault in Our Stars. For 1980s references that aren't overdone, I liked Carol Rifka Brunt's Tell the Wolves I'm Home. For dysfunctional family, try Jeannette Walls' The Glass Castle. As for me, this book may have scared me away from YA for awhile. I'm sticking with adult books, because I'm an adult who is getting grouchy about losing precious reading time on mediocre stories."}, {"Review": "Oh, man. This book made me feel ALL THE EMOTIONS! I ugly-cried at least five times while reading it. And, I can't lie, I didn't actually want to read it at all. It was one of those books I kept hearing buzz about, and words like \"gritty\" and \"romance\" and \"abuse\" and it just didn't sound like my kind of book at all. I also was a little annoyed that it was set in the 80's--what teen today is really interested in reading books about the 80's? But somehow it all came together for me. I loved Eleanor and Park--both as a couple and separately. And Park's family, and the way they dealt with Eleanor ... I'm going to cry again just thinking about it. And the ending--I was worried about that because that was the one slightly negative thing I kept hearing about the book, but the ending really worked for me.Here's the thing about this book for me--I had a pretty fortunate upbringing and it was obviously very different from Eleanor's. Yet, somehow, Rainbow Rowell made me feel what it would be like to be Eleanor. I identified with her so closely. And maybe that's partially because of the universality of Eleanor as a character--she's uncomfortable in her own skin, she can't understand why someone she likes as much as Park would like her, she doesn't feel deserving of love. Aren't these emotions all teenage girls feel at some point or another? I seriously wanted Rowell out of my teenage brain for a lot of this book--it could feel uncomfortably close to home.I don't know what else to say about this book. To me, it's deserving of all of the accolades, and I am definitely planning on reading whatever Rowell writes next. Edited to add: I decided to reread this book and listened to it on audio this time. The audio production is fabulous, and my review still stands. It's beautiful, and if possible I enjoyed it even more, and I still ugly cried at least 5 times (which is even worse when you're driving somewhere and have to go into work looking like someone who just cried her eyes out in the car. *sigh*). Something I noticed this time around: how real Eleanor is as a character. She's prickly and completely overly sensitive and so quick to believe the worst in people (even Park) and I think I loved her even more for it. She just felt so real. In an age where a lot of YA characters can feel like a Mary Sue character, it's so refreshing to have a character that isn't perfect all the time and doesn't have it all figured out. Like Park says, Eleanor is not \"sweet\" or \"nice.\" No, she's complicated and not ever boring. "}], "Genre": "Romance", "ID": "15745753", "Desc": ""}
