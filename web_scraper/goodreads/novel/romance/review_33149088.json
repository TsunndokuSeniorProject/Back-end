She is a thirty-three-year-old assistant district attorney. Her first case after two years is the murder of her occasional baby sitter (Tessa, eighteen-year-old). For this case she uses Lance\u2019s help. Lance was a former police officer but after a bullet on his leg, he joined to a PI firm. Morgan and Lance knew each other since high school. And They have some feelings toward each other from that time. He works on a case too, a missing girl. They think maybe these two case are connected to each other somehow.Okay, this story was really, really, really slow. The author didn\u2019t give anything to occupy my mind. I even didn\u2019t bother to think about the cases. I read first 70% and the things that I knew till then was from the first chapters, nothing more! Therefor I started to skim and skip. It didn\u2019t intrigued me, at all. The slowness of it was killing me. So many details that wasn\u2019t necessary to be said.The story is told in multiple POV, 3rd person. It\u2019s the first installment in \"Morgan Dane\" series but it can be read as a stand-alone. And I definitely do NOT reading the next book! I really didn\u2019t enjoy it. It fell flat for me but I hope you enjoy it more than me!"}, {"Review": "This novel eventually has some decent twists \u2013 clues uncovered by prosecutor Morgan and private eye Lance. When Morgan returns home to a small town after the death of her husband, she\u2019s about to take a promising job when a beloved neighborhood girl turns up brutally murdered and the seemingly nice boy Morgan has known for years is accused of her death. Morgan volunteers to defend him because she can\u2019t believe Nick did it. In doing so, she is potentially destroying her career and she is definitely incurring the wrath of her community. Morgan and Lance uncover clues that the police, who are already convinced Nick did it because they found his DNA inside her, do not. There is a slight romantic spark between the two, but not enough to call this romantic suspense. This novel was OK, but not compelling enough that I\u2019ll be reading anymore books in the series."}, {"Review": "As I read this book, many things occurred to me.1. I remembered that i am due for a cleaning at the dentist.2. I wanted to try a strawberry shortcake recipe I saw on Create TV.3. I also need an oil change... I think.4. Baking soda. My fridge needs a new box of baking soda!Oops, I'm reading this murder mystery! Or I am supposed to be. And its just not holding my interest. It's just not interesting enough. It's like chicken with no seasoning. Or tequila without lemon. Sex without an orgasm. You catch my drift yet? Something was just missing! I was re reading the same paragraph over and over again because I would just drift. (like in high school) If that's not a sign that a book had a capital B for Boring (For me anyhow) I don't know what is.The writing is average and lacking life and originality. The main characters needs so many more layers. And the hero has ZERO appeal. The mystery in itself is mediocre and the conclusion ties itself too nicely. The romance... a fart in the wind. It could have gone so much deeper.All in all... reading this book made me realize I got shit to do.This just didn't float my boat."}, {"Review": "4.5 Stars \u2014I decided to read \u201cSay You\u2019re Sorry\u201dby Melinda Leigh after noticing she had most of the top ranked books in the Kindle Unlimited store. After reading Leigh for the first time, I now understand why she is so popular. The book is written through the eyes of several different characters and Leigh does an excellent job of making you care for the two main characters (the Lawyer\u2014private detective duo, Morgan and Lance). They have a very flirtatious relationship and banter a lot \u2014- reminding me of the old television series \u201cMoonlighting\u201d. The mystery itself is pretty good as Morgan and Lance are retained as Lawyer and investigator for Jacob who is Morgan\u2019s neighbor and chief suspect in a girlfriend\u2019s murder. There are a lot of unexpected twists and turns that make the book hard to put down. The ending was a little too neat and clean for my taste and made me think back to the large number of red herrings that turned out not to have any connection with the murder or murderer that is eventually revealed. But, all in all very entertaining, and I will definitely be reading book #2 in this series to see what happens to these two likable characters "}, {"Review": "Morgan Dane has returned home to Scarlet Falls with her 3 daughters Ava 6, Mia 5 & young baby Sophie after her husband John was killed in Iraq an IED exploded killing him. Morgan takes on a job as a prosecutor as her family went into law enforcement. She works with Logan Kruger an ex cop now PI they are looking into the death of Tessa a well loved girl who was much loved by the townsfolk, but when Nick Zabrowski was arrested for her murder Morgan is flabbergasted , she doesn't think Nick would kill her as he hated the sight of blood his father told both Morgan & Logan so now its up to both of them to try & find out who did it?AS Dane & Kruger look deeper into the case they open a whole can of worms of suspects but they are yet to know who actually did it. There are a lots of twists & turns that keep you guessing right to the end, I just could not put this book down I usually don't read to many legal/ police procedurals but loved every minute it was fast paced well written strong premise. I also am intrigued whether the budding romance between Dane & Kruger goes, hopefully it will be a bit more written in the 2nd book Miss Leigh teases the reader by adding a bit of romance in the end.This is my first read by Melinda Leigh and wont be my last I am not into full on romance / suspense but this was a big surprise & the best thing is I've found a new author which makes this more enjoyable & rewarding. 5 BIG STARS "}, {"Review": "4.5 Stars!Say You\u2019re Sorry was a fantastic start to the Morgan Dane series, with wonderful characters and a compelling mystery that kept me guessing right until the very end.After losing her husband in Iraq, Morgan Dane has returned to her hometown of Scarlet Falls to raise her three girls with the help of her family. Say You\u2019re Sorry picks up two years after Morgan returned home as she plans to get back to work by starting a job at the DA\u2019s office. However, Morgan\u2019s life is thrown into chaos when her babysitter is murdered and her neighbor\u2019s son is accused of the crime. Believing Nick to be innocent, Morgan agrees to take on the case at the request of her neighbor. With the help of an old friend turned private eye, Morgan begins her investigation and aims to prove her neighbor is innocent and the real killer is still at large.Morgan is an incredibly strong character and really brave despite the difficulties she's facing while defending Nick's case. She also has a great sense of loyalty for those she cares about. I love how much she cares about her family and that even when she's busy with the case, she finds time to be with her daughters. Lance has had a difficult few months recovering from being shot while he was still on the police force. As a private detective, he has more freedom when it comes to his work, but he misses being on the force. Through his work as a P.I. he gets to work with Morgan, whom he has known since high school. I really enjoyed their working relationship, as well as the introduction of something more in their private life. I feel the two fit together very well and I'm excited to see where things go between them in future books.The mystery surrounding Tessa's death was intriguing. There were several suspects over the course of the book which led to constant twists and turns. I suspected several people, but never actually the person who was the killer. Getting chapters inside the killer's head gave great insight into how twisted the killer really was. I also enjoyed how the author wove several other small scandals/mysteries into the story.I read this book without reading the connecting series, Scarlet Falls, but had no issues understanding who everyone was and how they were all connected to each other. The author does a great job at making this its own series while including little Easter eggs for those familiar with the prior series. For being a romantic suspense book, Say You\u2019re Sorry is more on the thriller/mystery end, but there are enough elements of romance that seem to imply that may take more of a center role in future books.Overall, Say You\u2019re Sorry was a fun read with a ton of action and a compelling mystery. I\u2019m excited for more books to come out in this series as I really enjoyed these characters and the setting. I will definitely be checking out the connecting series, Scarlet Falls, soon.**I received an advanced copy from Netgalley and the publisher in exchange for an honest review.**"}, {"Review": "Morgan Dane is a widow with young kids living with her father and a troubled young woman she has pulled into her home. Her husband was killed in Iraq two years ago and she hasn't really been able to pull herself out of her grieve and move on with her life. She has just accepted a job with District Attorney's office and is trying to move forward. But before her job can start, she is pulled into looking for a girl, Tessa, who had babysat her young children. The grandparents can't find her and are getting nervous. Asking her friend Lance Kruger to help look for her, they discover her body in a teen hangout area. The police identify her neighbor Nick as the killer. She knows Nick. He plays chess with her father, her kids adore him and she doesn't want to believe he's guilty. Nick's dad doesn't have a lot of money, is working to mortgage his house for Nick's defense and asks Morgan for help.Putting her new job on the line, she teams up with Lance to prove Nick's innocence and find the real killer. Lance is a great guy. Previously injured with the police department, he is now working as a PI. Morgan and Lance also dated in high school, so there is a lot of friendship and history between them. Lance is not an OTT alpha hero (thank goodness)! He sacrifices for those he cares about. And he cares about Morgan. The romance is a very believable and a slow burn. The plot is really well paced as Morgan and Lance search for the killer of Tessa and try to prove the innocence of Nick. I don't want to give anything away, but it really pulled me in. You get a little bit of the killer's perspective (definitely a very sick individual) which adds to the overall suspense of the book. Say You're Sorry by Melinda Leigh is an excellent start to the new Morgan Dane series and now my favorite book written by her. For me it was a true 5 star read and once I started reading it, I couldn't put it down. The second book in the series comes out in September and it's definitely on my wish list.Thanks to NetGalley and Montlake Romance for an ARC of this book."}, {"Review": "Advanced Reader Copy (ARC) provided by the Author and Publisher via NetGalley in exchange for an fair and honest review.Solid mystery and the great start to a new series. The relationship between Morgan and Lance is sweet and Lance may be my new favorite Hero. I mean what woman can possibly resist a man who loves his mother with all her problems, loves her kids and plays the piano and sings to her? I'll add in blond, buff and hot, but, really isn't that just overkill?Morgan Dane lost her warrior husband to an IED in Iraq two years ago. She is a widow with three little girls to raise, a grandfather to help care for them and a young woman living with them who has serious medical issues. She has a full plate and now feels the need to return to work as an assistant district attorney to help battle the malaise that seems to have settled over her life like a cloud. Her occasional babysitter, Tessa, goes missing and Morgan calls her old high school flame and former Scarlet Lake Police Officer, Lance Kruger, to help her find Tessa. They find her dead at a high school hangout spot at the lake. At first the evidence points to Morgan's neighbor, Nick. How can a young man who reads stories to her little girls and plays chess with her grandfather possibly have done this?Morgan's answer is: He didn't. As Morgan begins to peal away the layers of the case against Nick, she uncovers a rush to judgment with serious political overtones that has put a lot of people in danger. She also discovers that she and Lance have the potential to become something other than friends and work associates."}, {"Review": "Morgan Dane has returned home to Scarlet Falls with her three young girls after the devastating loss of her husband in the military. She's agreed to take a job as a prosecutor following in her family's footsteps of putting away the bad guys until her neighbors son is arrested for murder. When Tessa was found raped and murdered the whole town wants justice but Morgan just has a gut feeling that there is no way Nick could have committed this crime having known both of them. Morgan decides to help defend Nick and do her own investigating with the help of Lance Kruger, an ex-cop turned private eye, to get her client off and find the real killer. Say You're Sorry if the first book of the Morgan Dane series by Melinda Leigh. The series is apparently a spin off from another series but I never found myself lost from not having read other books my this author and felt the story was built rather well without having read other background from other series but after this one I may just go back and pick up her other books. The story is a romantic suspense read that changes the point of view all throughout including some chapters from the prospective of the killer. Morgan however is the main character in the story, a former attorney who became a stay at home mom that is just returning back to work. Along with her former high school boyfriend turned P.I. they tackle the case to find a killer. The romance isn't overly pushed in the story letting a reader get invested more into the thriller side of the book as the investigation goes on. Overall, I really enjoyed this one from the explosive opening pages until the very end. I did decide to give this 4.5 stars just on one little detail from the end that I won't mention due to spoilers but otherwise a great read.

The accused is her neighbor's son, Nick, who is just a few years older than the sitter. Nick was a frequent visitor in Morgan's home, entertaining her daughters, playing chess or checkers with her father. Nick's father begs for help for him and Morgan agrees. Deep down, Morgan just cannot accept that Nick could murder anyone.Her decision turns her neighbors and friends against her and she loses the lucrative job before she even begins putting together a defense for Nick.

As they systematically interview and question the girl's friends and family, they learn that just about every teenager in town knows something they aren't sharing. Meanwhile more evidence is stacking up against Nick.Never a dull moment in this book! I really enjoyed how law enforcement worked with a private eye... just a touch of distrust on both sides, especially as the police looked in one direction only and never considered anyone else a suspect. There's an attraction between Morgan and Lance, she's a bit hesitant, he's determined not to scare her away. There's a little bit of everything here .... a sadistic killer, a young murder victim who argued with her grandparents the very last time they saw her, a young man accused of a brutal crime, who only wants to continue helping his father with a landscaping business, a friend of the victim who seems to be in hiding... but from what?Many thanks to the author / Montlake Romance / Netgalley for the digital copy of this romantic suspense.

Her husband was killed in the line of duty and she is still mourning 2 years later. She moved back to Scarlet Falls to live with her grandfather. She hasn\u2019t worked outside the home since her husband was killed. She finally decides it\u2019s time to re-enter the work force. She is an attorney and has agreed to go to work for the District Attorney\u2019s office. She receives a phone call late at night from the grandparents of a young girl who baby sits occasionally for her stating she is missing. Morgan calls Lance Kruger, an old high school boyfriend, whom she has become good friends with since her return to Scarlet Falls. Lance is currently working as a PI while on medical leave from the police department due to a gunshot wound to his thigh. They discover the girl\u2019s brutally murdered body. When Nick, her 20 year old neighbor, and friend of the family, is accused of killing his girlfriend, Morgan agrees to represent him pro bono. This ends her job with the DA\u2019s office before it even began. She goes to the PI office Lance works for to ask for their help. Morgan and Lance work well together. Morgan is still dealing with her past while trying to move forward. Lance is dealing with the loss of a job that defined him and trying to figure out his future. He\u2019s been interested in Morgan for a while, but knows she\u2019s not ready for a relationship, so has resolved himself to the friend zone. Plus, he\u2019s dealing with a mom who has mental health issues. Lance comes across as a stand up guy with unquestionable integrity, honesty and a big heart. Morgan shares those qualities. I loved that there was no histrionics, immature meltdowns, or ridiculous outbursts between Morgan and Lance. I never saw the killer coming! This rarely happens for me, so I was impressed! This book is a real page turner. There is also a great cast of supporting characters as well. Grandpa is a real sweetheart and very encouraging to Morgan. Morgan\u2019s girls are good kids. Her youngest is a bit of a spitfire! Lincoln Sharp is a retired detective and owner of the PI firm where Lance works. He is a father figure for Lance and another stand up guy.There isn\u2019t much romance to this romantic suspense. However, the ending has me hoping there\u2019s more to come in the following books!

But the fact that I cared about the injustices happening to fictional characters says a lot of good things about this author.The story was fluid and kept me on my toes. It's more mystery/suspense than romance. But that's fine with me. I didn't figure out who done it with absolute conviction. He (not a spoiler) was among my list of suspects, but I hadn't settled on him. This is a good thing.I look forward to more in this series.

I look forward to it."}, {"Review": "I\u2019ve become fond of Melinda Leigh\u2019s novels, especially the novellas and her collaboration with Kendra Elliott. Say You\u2019re Sorry is a very nice and interesting start to ML\u2019s Morgan Dane series. The story is about Morgan Dane, who is trying to get a handle of her life. She is hired as an assistant district attorney and comes from a line of cops in her family. Two years earlier, she\u2019d lost her husband in Iraq to violence, as well as her father. She is a widow raising three young children with her maternal grandfather, who just happens to be a retired cop and a young woman living with them who has severe medical issues.When her babysitter, Tessa goes missing and is later found dead, her boyfriend Nick, a teen Morgan has become familiar with, becomes the police\u2019s number one suspect. He is hurriedly charged with murdering Tessa to bolster the political appearances of some. Morgan finds herself on the defense side for the first time rather than prosecuting people. In an effort to help Nick, she turns to Lance Kruger, an ex-cop turned private eye and long-ago boyfriend now friend for help. As the two began to unravel the case, they set themselves on path of danger as well as others involved with the case. This story had me on edge quite a few times with its twists and some unpredictable turns. I thought the suspense was good and Morgan and Lance are a very sweet couple although the romantic tension dragged out a bit too long. I wanted to see them hook up a bit sooner since they were once high school sweethearts. Lance is a nice Hero that has many facets to his character in the story, especially one who loves and cares for his mother despite her many problems.Although I am used to Kate Rudd in ML\u2019s books, I think the narrator Chris Dukehart did a nice job of narrating some of the male voices very well. This was a very good suspense romance and I thoroughly enjoyed this first in the series.4.5 Stars"}, {"Review": "\nI am still relatively new to the thriller genre, I like to dip my toe in every now and then, however, in this book Melinda Leigh has tempted me to belly flop right in.\u00a0Say You're Sorry\u00a0captivated me from page one as you witness the murder first hand, after that, it wasn't a want, it was a\u00a0need;\u00a0I needed to keep reading and find out the full story.Morgan Dane is our main character, she's been widowed for two years and has 3 adorable small children, who she parents with the help of her father. Now, she has decided it's time for her to go back to work as a prosecutor. But, just as she's about to start her baby sitter is horrifically murdered and her neighbour is accused of the slaying. Morgan doesn't buy it. So with the help of her private investigator and former high school boyfriend, she decides to take up his defence.This book is so easy to get into, Morgan is such an identifiable figure, a single mother trying to do the best for her children and now juggling a stressful job. A stressful job where she isn't sure she's doing the right thing. And then there's Lance the PI assisting her with the case and a guy with some pressures of his own. The murder case itself, although interesting to follow, as soon as the murderer popped up I figured it out correctly but that didn't stop me from enjoying the ride to get there.It was Morgan and her relationship with people, her blossoming romance with Lance, her devotion to her family, her dedication to helping Nick - the young man accused of murder - that kept me glued to the book. I can't wait to read more in this series and I will definitely be looking up some more Melinda Leigh.*ARC provided by publisherReviewed by Suzanne\u2764 \u2661 Don't want to miss any of our posts?

I have not read the Scarlet Falls series that was published before this, so some of the connections were not clear at the beginning of the book, but it did not diminish the enjoyment I had while listening to this book. The narration was well done with a lot of expression that added to my enjoyment of the story.After losing her husband in Iraq, Morgan Dane has returned to her hometown of Scarlet Falls to raise her three girls with the help of her family. This story picks up two years after Morgan returned home. She has been offered a job working at the DA's office when her life is thrown into chaos. Her young neighbour has been accused of murdering her old babysitter. The family can not afford a top notch lawyer, and on impulse, Morgan offers to take his case pro bono. She is sure that he is innocent. Recruiting an old boyfriend and ex-cop, who is now working as a PI, they begin their investigation to prove Nick innocent. The only way to do that is to find the real killer. Morgan is an incredibly strong and brave character, in fact some may think she is rash and impulsive. She also has a great sense of loyalty for those she cares about which is how she ends up involved in this case at all. I love that, as busy as she is, she still makes sure she spends quality time with her daughters. Lance is dealing with his own issues. He was shot while still working on the police force and even though he enjoys the leeway he has working as a PI, he misses his prior job. I really enjoyed the working relationship Morgan and Lance have. They feed off each other well and Lance is very protective of Morgan. I will be watching to see if they develop a romantic relationship as this series moves forward. The mystery surrounding Tessa's death and the disappearance of another girl was intriguing. There were several suspects over the course of the book which led to constant twists and turns. Each of these suspects often revealed another secret in Scarlet Falls. I suspected several people, but never actually the person figured out the killer until just prior to the reveal. Some other readers thought the book was slow, but I felt the pace was just right. I listened to it in one day and didn't want to take any breaks, as I was pulled right into the story. This book is listed as a Romantic Suspense, but I think it was more Suspense Mystery, as I mentioned earlier, perhaps the romance is yet to come. I recommend this story to Mystery, Thriller, Suspense, or Romantic Suspense lovers.

It's been two years since she lost her husband in Iraq and she is thinking it is time she gets back to her \"pre-widow\" career of attorney. With a family rich in law enforcement, Morgan has been raised with a mindset of justice for the guilty and vindication for the innocent. A brutal rape and murder of local high school girl finds a polite young neighbor of Morgan's under suspicion for murder. Finding it hard to believe that the same boy who regularly plays chess with her grandfather and spends time in her home among her daughters is capable of such a heinous crime, she agrees to take on his case. I enjoyed following the story as it played out and thought the characters were well developed. The author gave you many opportunities to place blame on multiple persons only to take back the gleam of hope that you figured out the case. (My only objection was that perhaps there were too many possibilities.) A pretty good mystery, well written and perfectly ended to engage the reader in future cases and investigations for Morgan and Lance. I personally can see this story and future stories of Morgan in a Hallmark movies and mystery series. I received this ARC free of charge for an honest review.

"}, {"Review": "This is probably one of the best crime thrillers I've read in a while, and that is for a couple of reasons:1) Super-fast-adrenaline-punch narrative:  From the first page of the book until the end, you will be riding a roller coaster that never stops. There are no boring or slow passages in this book. No. It's super fast, a lot of things are happening and it really is what a thriller is supposed to be: thrilling. Each time you feel like the roller coaster is about to stop, something booming happens: you'll see that you haven't reached the end of the ride, but merely arrived to a peak in the ride, and should brace yourself for the steep fast spiraling descent to come.2) The main characters: Morgan & Lance:  I honestly loved them. They really were familiar to me, I was able to picture them perfectly: inside and out. I was in a constant state of can-you-please-kiss-already.3) You won't be able to figure out who the criminal is until the end:  Even though I had some suspicions, but no, I wasn't able to figure out who the criminal is. So good.4) Beautiful endingFor all crime, mystery, thriller lovers... this is a perfect book, and what's better? There are 4 more books in this series!!"}, {"Review": "As a huge fan of Leigh\u2019s Scarlet Falls series, I was so thrilled to learn about this spin-off and even more excited to revisit Lance and Morgan, both of whom were said to have a brief history in Stella and Mac\u2019s story. But Melinda Leigh is an author I can always count on for fantastic reads and \u2018Say You\u2019re Sorry\u2019 more than lives up to this billing. But I love Leigh\u2019s heroines and heroes for so many reasons: they use their smarts and wits and intelligence to get ahead (sometimes without even needing to fire a gun), they generally don\u2019t have immature meltdowns that are out of character and aren\u2019t afraid to admit their uncertainty and doubts even when cornered. The all-round maturity certainly helps. \u2018Say You\u2019re Sorry\u2019 introduces us to Morgan Dane, a district attorney whose life was blown wide open when her husband died during his deployment, leaving her to sort herself out back home with 3 young children. But the fragility and vulnerability never quite go away no matter how much she convinces herself that the time to move on has arrived, up until a case convinces her to do what\u2019s right rather than what\u2019s convenient. Leigh ratchets up the tension from the start and very much like every episode of a TV crime series, begins the show with the panicked pants of a potential victim who flees an unknown killer, who surprisingly, acts uncontrollably because of his own self-preservation instincts. But what looks like a simple teenage case of murder unearths a whole load of secrets and several twists that I didn\u2019t see coming, which made the ride more exciting. I liked both Morgan and Lance together, and loved their partnership which seems to bode very well for the next few books that Leigh has in mind. Morgan\u2019s strong sense of justice appealed to me deeply, especially when it came to her determination to see a falsely-accused teenager out of jail for a crime he didn\u2019t commit while tanking her career in the process. Lance\u2019s solid character was as well, a perfect complement for Morgan's. His broken dreams have left him a position where he hasn\u2019t been able to be anything other than the police officer he once was, but there\u2019s a sense of untouchable integrity and dignity about him that makes him quite a shining example of what a romantic hero should be. \u2019Say You\u2019re Sorry\u2019 is however, more focused on the suspense than romance, heavy with the potential of Morgan/Lance which sort of remains unfulfilled by the end of the book, but I\u2019m hoping there\u2019re more to come that will deepen this relationship between the both of them. I\u2019m still vacillating between feeling a little cheated out of hot and heavy times and satisfied because justice is finally served, but as long as Leigh delivers these in the next few books, I\u2019d be happy as a clam. *ARC by netgalley(always grateful, mind)"}, {"Review": "Check out all of my reviews at: http://www.avonnalovesgenres.comI am so excited that Melinda Leigh is writing a spin-off of her wonderful Scarlet Falls trilogy.

You also follow the story through both Morgan\u2019s and Lance\u2019s points-of-views, with some internal insights from the killer and Nick\u2019s time in lock-up. I loved the multiple views because they pull you into the head and intense emotions of each character in every situation.I was happy to learn from the author that there are at least four more proposed books for this series and Morgan will continue being the main character. This book has the beginnings of a new romance for Morgan with Lance and I am looking forward to its progression. I love a series that not only gives me great thrills and/or mysteries, but I get to follow a couple that I want to succeed in love.I am looking forward to the next book and a return to all of these great characters!Thank you very much to Montlake Romance, Melinda Leigh and Net Galley for allowing me to read this eARC in exchange for an honest review. "}, {"Review": "Well that was good. The Gist: Morgan's babysitter has been brutally murdered. And the boy next door has been accused of the crime. Morgan, though, is certain he's not guilty and decides to defend him in court even if it's the unpopular opinion. Now she just has to prove he's innocent. The Story:I enjoyed the mystery. The storyline bops around for different points of view-- Morgan, the boy accused and the killer-- as the crime is investigated and days go by. It was a good mystery. Kept me interested and wondering how they'd piece it all together. There's a hint of romance between Morgan and her friend who is helping her. I liked them as a team and how they interacted. It'll be fun seeing how their relationship evolves now that she's back in town and they're coworkers. The Narration:This was my first time with Chris Dukehart. She took a little getting used to. Took me a bit to find the right speed. I ended up listening at 1.0x which is really slow for me but what suited her narration best. She did a good job with the male/female voices. My main quip with her was the children's voices (Morgan's kids). Not a deal breaker, though. But she did a good job with pacing and once I was used to her voice (couple chapters) it was easy to get lost in the narration and before I realized 11 hours had passed in less than 2 days. Whoa! I'll listen to the rest on audio without hesitation. "}, {"Review": "\nI am still relatively new to the thriller genre, I like to dip my toe in every now and then, however, in this book Melinda Leigh has tempted me to belly flop right in. Say You\u2019re Sorry captivated me from page one as you witness the murder first hand, after that, it wasn\u2019t a want, it was a need; I needed to keep reading and find out the full story.Morgan Dane is our main character, she\u2019s been widowed for two years and has 3 adorable small children, who she parents with the help of her father. Now, she has decided it\u2019s time for her to go back to work as a prosecutor. But, just as she\u2019s about to start her baby sitter is horrifically murdered and her neighbour is accused of the slaying. Morgan doesn\u2019t buy it. So with the help of her private investigator and former high school boyfriend, she decides to take up his defence.This book is so easy to get into, Morgan is such an identifiable figure, a single mother trying to do the best for her children and now juggling a stressful job. A stressful job where she isn\u2019t sure she\u2019s doing the right thing. And then there\u2019s Lance the PI assisting her with the case and a guy with some pressures of his own. The murder case itself, although interesting to follow, as soon as the murderer popped up I figured it out correctly but that didn\u2019t stop me from enjoying the ride to get there.It was Morgan and her relationship with people, her blossoming romance with Lance, her devotion to her family, her dedication to helping Nick \u2013 the young man accused of murder \u2013 that kept me glued to the book. I can\u2019t wait to read more in this series and I will definitely be looking up some more Melinda Leigh."}, {"Review": "After taking a couple of years off work to spend time with her daughters after her husband was killed in Iraq, Morgan Dane is ready to return to work as a prosecutor. Except before she even gets started in her new job, tragedy strikes in the small town of Scarlet Falls. Even worse, the crime is being pinned on someone Morgan believes is innocent and she's determined to do whatever it takes to see the right person bought to justice. Will she succeed or will she face a tough, uphill battle that could turn deadly at any time?What a highly entertaining, fast-paced, gripping read Ms. Leigh has penned in this book, encompassing well-written dialogue that kept me enthralled from start to finish; a plot with lots of twists and turns that kept surprising me and had me determined to discover what would come next; and two main characters that were determined to do what was right in seeking justice for the victim no matter how dangerous things became. The way this story started had me on the edge-of-my seat and drew me into the story immediately with what was happening, as it's palpable that any number of people could be a suspect. What would happen to whoever was in trouble? Would they be saved? As for the dialogue, it was told from several characters points-of-view and was intense due to the main characters back stories and all that they go through to prove Morgan's client is innocent. Going head-to-head with several secondary characters that are either extremely dangerous or very influential in the community should concern Morgan, but no matter what threats or scrutiny she faces, she remains loyal to her job and strong and brave in her determination to seek the truth when everyone is determined to prosecute her client just so their jobs are secure. But what I liked most about Morgan is that she didn't back down, especially when things became more and more dangerous for her, Lance and her client. While Lance, he's been through a lot in past months with having to give up working as a cop. It wasn't easy, but he's overcome it to become a very good private investigator. Moreover, I liked that he was willing to help Morgan, even though he wasn't as certain as the heroine was about her client's innocence. Yet, what I liked most of all about the hero was how protective he was of the heroine and how they wouldn't give up until they discovered the truth. Overall, Ms. Leigh has delivered an incredible read in this book where the suspense and growing relationship between Lance and Morgan made this story a real page turner. The way this story ended was a tad alarming because of the situation Morgan finds herself in, but I liked that Morgan was finally able to move on from her past and the death of her husband. And lastly, I'm looking forward to more of this series because of the main and secondary characters, especially Lance's mom, a bright woman with a serious medical condition that makes Lance continually worry about her; and Sharp, Lance's boss and a man that is determined to make everyone a health nut. The moments where he was trying to convince Morgan what was good for her had me amused. I would highly recommend Say You're Sorry by Melinda Leigh, if you enjoy romantic suspense or books by authors Kendra Elliot, Mary Burton, Rita Herron or Nancy Bush.

Multi-layered and swift-moving, with a smart, likable, kick-ass heroine who is no one\u2019s damsel in distress, Say You\u2019re Sorry is the opening volume of Leigh\u2019s new Morgan Dane series. (Advance Reading Copy obtained by request from NetGalley.)"}, {"Review": "Oh what a\u00a0tangled web the author weaved in the art of deceiving. The murder of a girl opens a Pandora's box of a litany\u00a0of secrets, lies and other nefarious happenings in Scarlett Falls. This new series is set in a location fans of Melinda Leigh's will be familiar with. It's a spin off of her Scarlet Falls trilogy series and features the sister of Stella Dane who was the heroine in the last book of that series. Morgan Dane is a widow who was left with 3 young daughters to raise on her own after her husband died in Iraq. She's recently moved back home to Scarlet Falls to live with her grandfather who helps with the girls. After two years of taking a break from her job as an assistant DA to grieve, she has decided to go back to work in the same field but before she starts her plans get derailed when she decides to be the lawyer for a 20 year old family friend who has just been accused of viciously murdering his girlfriend. She enlist the help of a childhood friend, Lance Kruger who is currently working as a Private Investigator for Lincoln Sharp. Great start to the series with a strong female lead who uses her intelligence to solve problems, can psychically take care of herself but yet also isn't afraid to show a vulnerable side. Lance is also a strong leading male character but without being to over the top alpha. He and Morgan work great together along with Sharp and I look forward to seeing them solve more cases together in future books. "}], "Genre": "Romance", "ID": "33149088", "Desc": ""}
